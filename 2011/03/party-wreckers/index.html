			<h2>Party wreckers!</h2>

			
			<div class="entry">
				<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">The KLF at the BRIT Awards</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CDButf0go8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The KLF built a career on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">formulaically safe music</a>. So formulaic, in fact, that they wrote a detailed manual on how to make it. They knew they were making music whose prime characteristic was that chumps could easily digest it.<br />
<span id="more-61"></span><br />
By 1992, they decided they were done with it, so at the BRIT awards (an industry award show like the Grammys), they invited Extreme Noise Terror, a British grindcore band, to play a version of their hit 3 AM Eternal with them.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like audience received it rather well, so this isn&#8217;t a perfect example of the kind of party wrecking of which I&#8217;m thinking. Still, it&#8217;s a great instance of  people that are accustomed to getting what they want (and defining what others get) <i>not</i> getting what they want.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Andy Kaufman reading the Great Gatsby</a></p>
<p><span class="frame-outer  alignnone size-full wp-image-62"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.43.26-AM.png" alt="" title="Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby." width="415" height="305" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" /></a></span></span></span></span></span><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts run by stand-up comedians lately, and I get the impression there&#8217;s immense pressure to connect and deliver. Kaufman got shows booked because of his role as Latka on the sitcom Taxi, and people were expecting for something sort of similar to that sort of comedy. Also, they were expecting stand-up comedy. Knowing this, Kaufman decided that what he&#8217;d rather do is read them the Great Gatsby. So he did, despite boos and disappointment. And of course, he did create comedy. Not for the people there, though, who were the ones putting the pressure on him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not completely clear why I think this is so great. I&#8217;m critical of a lot of performance art and have been part of an unappreciative audience. When I was younger and thought that yelling could actually make a band deviate from its set, I would try to get Slayer to play Spill the Blood. Unlike an awards show audience, I don&#8217;t think a stand-up comedy audience needs to &#8220;eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose this performance pits empathy for a defiant artist against empathy for expectant patrons. Kaufman&#8217;s act happens to be brave enough and defiant enough to win here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Metallica at the 1989 Grammys</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7oZyWt7pGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just footage of the performance. I couldn&#8217;t find something with shots of the audience.)</p>
<p>To provide some context, the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Billboard top 20</a> then was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>01. Look Away » Chicago<br />
02. My Prerogative » Bobby Brown<br />
03. Every Rose Has Its Thorn » Poison<br />
04. Straight Up » Paula Abdul<br />
05. Miss You Much » Janet Jackson<br />
06. Cold Hearted » Paula Abdul<br />
07. Wind Beneath My Wings » Bette Midler<br />
08. Girl You Know Its True » Milli Vanilli<br />
09. Baby, I Love Your Way-Freebird » Will To Power<br />
10. Giving You The Best That I Got » Anita Baker<br />
11. Right Here Waiting » Richard Marx<br />
12. Waiting For A Star To Fall » Boy Meets Girl<br />
13. Lost In Your Eyes » Debbie Gibson<br />
14. Don&#8217;t Wanna Lose You » Gloria Estefan<br />
15. Heaven » Warrant<br />
16. Girl I&#8217;m Gonna Miss You » Milli Vanilli<br />
17. The Look » Roxette<br />
18. She Drives Me Crazy » Fine Young Cannibals<br />
19. On Our Own » Bobby Brown<br />
20. Two Hearts » Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that was the world that the record industry celebrated, and that was the world of the Grammys.</p>
<p>In the other corner, Metallica had never been on commercial radio, much less on TV on a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; awards show like the Grammys. Before they began the long process of revealing their fallibility and humanness that started around 1991, they were perceived as something akin to a force, rather than as a group of musicians. Sort of like a comet. You might think a comet is awesome, but it is driven by forces outside of the control of man.</p>
<p>This was quite the collision. </p>
<p>Having been introduced to Metallica by the black album, I did not witness the Grammy performance live. When I did see and read about this in the nineties, I absolutely loved the audience reaction. Some of it thought it was novel and cheered, but there were plenty of Clive Davis types that were just stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect that, and they did not have a good time. </p>
<p>And as a guy that did not have a good time at all with the pop music that was hard to get away from back then, I liked that a lot.<br />

<p><span class="frame-outer  alignnone size-full wp-image-63"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879#" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.49.59-AM.png" alt="" title="Colbert at the White House Correspondents&#039; Association Dinner" width="415" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>You probably remember this, but just in case you don&#8217;t: This dinner is a yearly celebration held by the reporters that cover the White House. The president of the United States is there. No matter how atrocious he may be, the speakers and reporters at the dinner rib him gently and chum it up real good.</p>
<p>Colbert stood about <i>ten feet away</i> from President George W. Bush and just rained crushing bombs on him for half an hour. Iraq, an inability to accept facts, and the politically motivated leak of a CIA field agent&#8217;s identity were all brought up. Yup, uncomfortable, amazing stuff. This was party wrecking at the highest level of power, and it required serious perseverance in addition to bravery and cleverness. </p>
