					<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />

					<blockquote><p>There was a time when the forests of the Niu Mountain were beautiful. But can the mountain any longer be regarded as beautiful, since being situated near a big city, the woodsmen have hewed the trees down? The days and nights gave it rest, and the rains and the dew continued to nourish it, and a new life was continually springing up from the soil, but then the cattle and the sheep began to pasture upon it. That is why the Niu Mountain looks so bald, and when people see its baldness, they imagine that there was never any timber on the mountain. Is this the true nature of the mountain? And is there not a heart of love and righteousness in in man, too? But how can that nature remain beautiful when it is hacked down every day as the woodsman chops down the trees with his ax? To be sure, the nights and days do the healing and there is nourishing air of the early dawn, which tends to keep him sound and normal, but this morning air is thin and is soon destroyed by what he does in the day.  With this continuous hacking of the human spirit, the rest and recuperation obtained during the next are not sufficient to maintain its level, then the man degrades himself to a state not far from the beast&#8217;s. People see that he acts like beast and imagine that there was never any true character in him. But is this the true nature of man?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>No, Mencius, it is not! No way, man. (Although I&#8217;m not sure all the beasts are in such a bad state.)</p>
<p>I think we all know that getting rest is valuable. However, I often think of it as valuable in the sense that it is good for regaining productivity. Work productivity, artistic productivity, organizational productivity, or physical productivity. You rest, then once again you are able to dig and work toward some goal or other.</p>
<p>Mencius values rest in a different way.  <a href="http://death-mountain.com/2011/01/the-continuous-hacking-of-the-human-spirit/#more-58" class="more-link">Continue reading</a></p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve encountered some weird dialogue out in the world lately.</p>

				<!-- <div class="info">by Jim</div> -->

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I recently participated in <a href="http://hmtpng.com" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/hmtpng.com?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">Hometaping</a>. Hometaping is one of those &#8220;do something in a month&#8221; projects. It&#8217;s like National Novel Writing Month, in that it&#8217;s held in November, and like RPM, in that it&#8217;s about making an album. I attempted this last year and failed, although I did get one song out of it, which is one more than I would have written otherwise.</p>
<p>This year, I finished a group of songs that could arguably called an album. <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">You can stream or download it here.</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only 19 minutes, but there&#8217;s seven fairly complete songs. And in the process of writing these songs, I did a handful of improvisations that were fun, even if not all of them made it on the album. (Two of them did.) I didn&#8217;t complete every song I started, either, but I did beat the expectations I had at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>While making this album, I learned a lot of things! According to <a href="http://asianniceguy.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/asianniceguy.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">this guy</a>, life is essentially about three things: Living, loving, and learning. So, I think we can all agree: It is fairly good that I learned.</p>
<p>A lot of what I learned I already knew. (And a lot of what I learned, <i>you</i> already knew.) As strange as that may sound, knowing isn&#8217;t the same as learning. Often, learning is not an on/off kind of thing. Some people read about something and instantly absorb it. Not me, though. I usually have to bump into the problem that the solution solves and flail at it uselessly in my own way before accepting the solution.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So. These things I learned (again) while making this album, and I was glad to learn them!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Even though I don&#8217;t listen to albums as albums very much any more, albums as a unit of work are still useful.</b></p>
<p>I tend to give a new album one or two listens. After that, its songs are absorbed into my sea of music and will pop up at random, disassociated with its album-mates. Every so often, I will hear a song on shuffle, then seek the album. But even then, I might not listen to them in order. I know some people that do still listen to music as albums, but with the way Kids These Days are going, the concept of the album as unit of art to be consumed as a whole is going to find less and less purchase.</p>
<p>As a unit of work, however, I find the album to still be a strong idea. I&#8217;m accustomed to working on one song at a time. During the making of this album, there was some very useful momentum. I didn&#8217;t have to warm up. Buying in bulk is good stuff, even in music writing, it seems. I ended up with 7+ songs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the number of songs I&#8217;ve made each year. (This chart leaves off the many, many noise improvisations I did around 2003.)</p>

					<p>Yesterday, I picked up a graph paper notebook and some blank index cards. They were 37¢! (Back to school supply sales: Still somehow captivating.)</p>
<p>I already drew a dungeon in the notebook. Then, I drew some guys fighting.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know why grids inspire freehand drawing of figures that don&#8217;t seem to take advantage of grids, until a little while ago, when I found out about <a href="http://www.thegridsystem.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thegridsystem.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">grid-based design</a>. A lot of magazine and web page layouts that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a grid are actually rooted in grids. They impose a subconscious order that appeals to your brain.

<p>It&#8217;s an accident that a drawing of one situation flipped over looks like a drawing of another situation, but I bet it&#8217;s not all that common when drawing grappling situations. </p>

					<p>If you haven&#8217;t read about <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/KeyValueCoding.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/KeyValueCoding.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fpage%2F2%2F');">Key-Value Coding</a> in Cocoa, and you like generic programming, you should do so! By letting you use strings to find and invoke the properties of an object, it opens up a lot of possibilities. I&#8217;ll let the documentation speak to that, though.</p>
<p>Key paths are one element of KVC that&#8217;s handy, but doesn&#8217;t work in one case that seemed to come up a lot in my experience. Keypaths let you traverse an object hierarchy by means of a string that chains together the names of properties, separated by dots. </p>
<p>[person valueForKeyPath:@"contactinfo.address.street.orientation"];</p>
<p>The above line would call the person object&#8217;s contactinfo property, then call the address property on the result of contactinfo call, then call the street property on the result of the address call, then finally call the orientation property on the result of street call.</p>
<p>Pretty handy, but it does break down when you throw an array into the mix. Say contactinfo had an addresses property that returned an array of address objects instead of just one. There&#8217;s no way to express which element of that array you want via a key path, so you have traverse the hierarchy the old-fashioned way. Boo-hoo, eh?</p>
<p>Well, sure. But any time you do have to do something a lot of times, a minor inconvenience gets annoying. So, I got around this by making myself a basic implementation keypaths with array accessors. Here it is:<br />

<p>Bravest Ever is likely to bring you consistent sketch-satisfaction! She actually has a  a posting schedule, so disappearing for a month at a time is much less likely over there.</p>
<p>This is not to say you should leave Death Mountain! After all, we have <a href="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/06/Gibdo.gif">mummies</a> here.</p>
<p>However, I am privy to the sketches and paintings that may possibly show up on Bravest Ever, and I have to say, people might have a better time with them than they might reading about <a href="http://death-mountain.com/2010/04/rgb-hsv-and-hue-shifting/">programming HSV changes with RGB values</a>. They feature imagination, aesthetic satisfaction, and Lazy Intern.</p>

Judging by the reaction in the comments on that article, many hockey (and &#8220;hocky&#8221;) fans are upset by this.<br /><span class="frame-outer  alignnone"><span><span><span><span>
<img alt="" src="http://strangeherring.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/hayden-panettiere-stanley-cup-01.jpg" title="The Stanley Cup is purely a family affair." class="alignnone" width="400" height="265" /></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Why? Well for one, the Cup&#8217;s presence at the parade may inspire gays to overrun and dominate the sport of hockey, the way they took over the sport of figure skating, back in 1971. The prized Borman Chalice, then the highest honor in figure skating, appeared at a Pride parade in San Francisco, and it was all downhill from there. Prior to that, figure skating had been the straight white male&#8217;s haven from turbulent (and tiresome) social change. A man could go down to the rink, enjoy a brew, and watch some men triple axle it up, secure in the faith that he was gazing at twirling buttocks which were <i>completely impenetrable</i>, like two iron bowling balls fused together in the manliest blacksmith fires of Germany.</p>
