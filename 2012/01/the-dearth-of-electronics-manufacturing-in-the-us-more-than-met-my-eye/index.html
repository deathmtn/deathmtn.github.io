			<h2>The dearth of electronics manufacturing in the US: More than met my eye</h2>

			
			<div class="entry">
				<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2F');">article</a> provoked quite a few thoughts, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the time to write an essay. I don&#8217;t really have any solutions to these problems, so an essay-style piece would just be pretty wrapping for fragments anyway.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my fragments:</p>
<p>- I thought manufacturing in Shenzhen was mostly a matter of costs for technology companies. It&#8217;s not.</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular, companies say they need engineers with more than high school, but not necessarily a bachelor’s degree. Americans at that skill level are hard to find, executives contend.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple’s executives had estimated that about 8,700 industrial engineers were needed to oversee and guide the 200,000 assembly-line workers eventually involved in manufacturing iPhones. The company’s analysts had forecast it would take as long as nine months to find that many qualified engineers in the United States.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would have loved to buy a &#8220;fair-trade&#8221; iPhone that cost $600 or so. But it turns out not even that is possible.<br />
<span id="more-84"></span><br />
- Why don&#8217;t we have these technical workers? Well, &#8220;many reasons&#8221; is always the right answer, but I think our fetishization (or maybe &#8220;fetishization&#8221; is an over-emphatic way of saying &#8220;over-emphasization&#8221;) of Making It to the Top is part of it. Our insistence that everyone strive to be important millionaires makes vocational jobs (I know &#8211; redundant, but I can&#8217;t think of how better to describe them) seem like loser business, so people go for bachelor&#8217;s degrees in something they can&#8217;t get work doing. We&#8217;re forcing too many variously-shaped pegs through round holes.</p>
<p>Have you made fun of DeVry? I know I have. Yet, it&#8217;s good work, and people could be happy doing it.</p>
<p>- Factories are in China, not just because of the labor cost and available skill, but because everything else is also there, which makes logistics easier and cheaper.</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire supply chain is in China now,” said another former high-ranking Apple executive. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets? That’s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away. You need that screw made a little bit different? It will take three hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d actually heard about a pro-US effect of proximity last week: American stringed instruments factories are still competitive with Chinese ones because of the prohibitive cost of shipping cellos and double basses overseas. Yup, didn&#8217;t think of this one, either.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s not just, oh, we tweak this or we tweak that, and we get manufacturing work back. There has to be a manufacturing &#8220;community&#8221; in place. And to get that, we&#8217;d have to commit to developing for decades.</p>
<p>I have doubts about our ability as a nation to commit to anything for decades.</p>
<p>- I don&#8217;t think that we necessarily need to bring back electronics manufacturing in order to prosper. (We do, however, need to use our work force in better and more varied ways.) However, I&#8217;ve heard people, when discussing how well the American economy is doing, point to Apple and Google or some other fantastically successful company.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you scale up from selling one million phones to 30 million phones, you don’t really need more programmers,” said Jean-Louis Gassée, who oversaw product development and marketing for Apple until he left in 1990. “All these new companies — Facebook, Google, Twitter — benefit from this. They grow, but they don’t really need to hire much.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what does that get the country as a whole? It gets us prestige, which not worth nothing. But the success of multinational corporations that started in US doesn&#8217;t really help you or me (yeah, some of you work for these companies, so it does help you, but you know what I&#8217;m saying) all that much.</p>
