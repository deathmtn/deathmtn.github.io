			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">article</a> provoked quite a few thoughts, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the time to write an essay. I don&#8217;t really have any solutions to these problems, so an essay-style piece would just be pretty wrapping for fragments anyway.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my fragments:</p>
<p>- I thought manufacturing in Shenzhen was mostly a matter of costs for technology companies. It&#8217;s not.</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular, companies say they need engineers with more than high school, but not necessarily a bachelor’s degree. Americans at that skill level are hard to find, executives contend.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple’s executives had estimated that about 8,700 industrial engineers were needed to oversee and guide the 200,000 assembly-line workers eventually involved in manufacturing iPhones. The company’s analysts had forecast it would take as long as nine months to find that many qualified engineers in the United States.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would have loved to buy a &#8220;fair-trade&#8221; iPhone that cost $600 or so. But it turns out not even that is possible.<br />
<span id="more-84"></span><br />
- Why don&#8217;t we have these technical workers? Well, &#8220;many reasons&#8221; is always the right answer, but I think our fetishization (or maybe &#8220;fetishization&#8221; is an over-emphatic way of saying &#8220;over-emphasization&#8221;) of Making It to the Top is part of it. Our insistence that everyone strive to be important millionaires makes vocational jobs (I know &#8211; redundant, but I can&#8217;t think of how better to describe them) seem like loser business, so people go for bachelor&#8217;s degrees in something they can&#8217;t get work doing. We&#8217;re forcing too many variously-shaped pegs through round holes.</p>
<p>Have you made fun of DeVry? I know I have. Yet, it&#8217;s good work, and people could be happy doing it.</p>
<p>- Factories are in China, not just because of the labor cost and available skill, but because everything else is also there, which makes logistics easier and cheaper.</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire supply chain is in China now,” said another former high-ranking Apple executive. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets? That’s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away. You need that screw made a little bit different? It will take three hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d actually heard about a pro-US effect of proximity last week: American stringed instruments factories are still competitive with Chinese ones because of the prohibitive cost of shipping cellos and double basses overseas. Yup, didn&#8217;t think of this one, either.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s not just, oh, we tweak this or we tweak that, and we get manufacturing work back. There has to be a manufacturing &#8220;community&#8221; in place. And to get that, we&#8217;d have to commit to developing for decades.</p>
<p>I have doubts about our ability as a nation to commit to anything for decades.</p>
<p>- I don&#8217;t think that we necessarily need to bring back electronics manufacturing in order to prosper. (We do, however, need to use our work force in better and more varied ways.) However, I&#8217;ve heard people, when discussing how well the American economy is doing, point to Apple and Google or some other fantastically successful company.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you scale up from selling one million phones to 30 million phones, you don’t really need more programmers,” said Jean-Louis Gassée, who oversaw product development and marketing for Apple until he left in 1990. “All these new companies — Facebook, Google, Twitter — benefit from this. They grow, but they don’t really need to hire much.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what does that get the country as a whole? It gets us prestige, which not worth nothing. But the success of multinational corporations that started in US doesn&#8217;t really help you or me (yeah, some of you work for these companies, so it does help you, but you know what I&#8217;m saying) all that much.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to this <a href="http://edwardsung.com/post/5161080336/drive-to-place-on-tuesday-may-3rd-is-it-morning" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/edwardsung.com/post/5161080336/drive-to-place-on-tuesday-may-3rd-is-it-morning?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">podcast</a> in which the hosts, Hannah and Edward, discuss how to approach people&#8217;s enthusiasm about the long-awaited killing of Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>The death of Osama bin Laden means quite a bit symbolically, but I don&#8217;t think that is going to translate to that much real-world effect, and it sounds like Edward and Hannah don&#8217;t think it will, either. If you ascribe to this point of view, it means that a lot of people are confusing the way in which this event is significant.</p>
<p>The question they ponder is: Should people that don&#8217;t really think this is going to change much just go along with the people that think this defines the start of a new era? Maybe this is a case in which the enthusiasm and positivity is more important that the reality of the situation, Edward ponders.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s trouble when enthusiasm is built on a false premise, like I think Hannah was saying. Man, just writing that last sentence felt totally wet blanketesque and possibly sanctimonious! But you gotta be willing to risk sanctimony in order to make sure as many of us as possible are focused on the real deal.</p>
<p>I do agree with them in that there&#8217;s no gain in smacking people down for feeling good. You cannot deny the honesty of their reactions, even if you disagree with the conclusions that spring from them. So, it&#8217;s a pretty fine line to walk, what with the keeping people you know connected to reality while also not being a shit. I think I&#8217;ve settled on, &#8220;I am glad you have achieved closure at last! However, feeling closure doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the world is significantly better.&#8221; Which, again sounds a bit sanctimonious! I&#8217;ll have to work on that.</p>
<p>But better to be sanctimonious than to tacitly help build a false reality from which bad decisions are made. Many of our biggest problems today grew this way. And I know that there&#8217;s a lot of people that are mostly interested in believing in whatever what makes them feel good. It is still worth trying, though. Even if it makes you look like a shit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/03/ask-korean-news-north-korean-special.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/03/ask-korean-news-north-korean-special.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Ask a Korean</a> translated part of a fascinating interview with a North Korean Special Forces commando that had defected to South Korea.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Im Cheon-Yong (45) was a captain of North Korean Special Forces. He is relatively short &#8212; not quite 170 cm [TK: 5' 7"] &#8212; but had unusually large fists, reminiscent of a cartoon character. The fact that this reporter met an officer of North Korean military&#8217;s special combat unit became even more real after he explained, &#8220;I practiced punching several thousand times a day.&#8221; His handshake was firm and heavy.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The training for special combat as told by Mr. Im was harsh as expected, and some parts beyond imagination. The training begins on 5 a.m. The fundamental of the training is to turn the entire body into steely firmness, and the basic part is training the fist.</p>
<p>Mr. Im said, &#8220;You would wrap a tree trunk with ropes, and keep punching it. You throw 5000 punches day and night &#8212; do that for a month, the inside of your fist swells up until you can barely curl your fingers.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Then you open a tin can and set it up on a stand. You keep punching the sharp part. When your hand turns into mush with blood and pus, you start punching a pile of salt. Repeat it, and your hands become like a stone.&#8221; Mr. Im explained, &#8220;You punch the salt so that the salt would prevent the hand from rotting away with the blood.&#8221; According to Mr. Im, with the hand trained like this &#8220;you can easily break 20 sheets of cement blocks, and you can kill a person with three punches.&#8221; His hands would naturally make a fist throughout the interview. This reporter had to respectfully ask that he unclench his fist during the interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember hearing about this kind of thing as a kid. (I was told the rumor was that North Korean special forces could climb brick walls using just their fingers.) Despite the evils of North Korea, I thought it would be incredibly cool if such legendary soldiers existed. Now I&#8217;m an adult, and I know they exist, yet I find it sad.</p>
<p>The truth is that this insane training is sadly not that relevant. This is a time in which their opponents will very likely be armed, and those that won&#8217;t be would be easy to beat up anyway, without iron fist kung fu. It&#8217;s not even that relevant in unarmed combat &#8211; as Mr. Im probably knows, punching is not viable or possible in some phases of combat. Some South Korean bodyguard could clinch up with him, and the years of tree-punching go out the window.</p>
<p>Having these rock-like fists is more convenient than picking up a rock or blackjack, but it is still not worth it. That effort and time spent punching trees (and recovering from punching trees and losing fine motor skills) could be spent on other aspects of hand-to-hand combat, or better yet &#8211; armed combat or tactics. Even learning about South Korean government and society could help them be better assassins more effectively than clubbing their hands.</p>
<p>This is such a tragic waste of incredible willpower and human potential, even in the context of the horrible field of assassination. What could these guys be doing if they weren&#8217;t lead by childish morons?</p>
<p>These commandos are pushing human limits in order to do something that is largely archaic and useless. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re not the only citizens of North Korea doing so, and that is just another horrific aspect of life in that country.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">The KLF at the BRIT Awards</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CDButf0go8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The KLF built a career on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">formulaically safe music</a>. So formulaic, in fact, that they wrote a detailed manual on how to make it. They knew they were making music whose prime characteristic was that chumps could easily digest it.<br />
<span id="more-61"></span><br />
By 1992, they decided they were done with it, so at the BRIT awards (an industry award show like the Grammys), they invited Extreme Noise Terror, a British grindcore band, to play a version of their hit 3 AM Eternal with them.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like audience received it rather well, so this isn&#8217;t a perfect example of the kind of party wrecking of which I&#8217;m thinking. Still, it&#8217;s a great instance of  people that are accustomed to getting what they want (and defining what others get) <i>not</i> getting what they want.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Andy Kaufman reading the Great Gatsby</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.43.26-AM.png" alt="" title="Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby." width="480" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts run by stand-up comedians lately, and I get the impression there&#8217;s immense pressure to connect and deliver. Kaufman got shows booked because of his role as Latka on the sitcom Taxi, and people were expecting for something sort of similar to that sort of comedy. Also, they were expecting stand-up comedy. Knowing this, Kaufman decided that what he&#8217;d rather do is read them the Great Gatsby. So he did, despite boos and disappointment. And of course, he did create comedy. Not for the people there, though, who were the ones putting the pressure on him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not completely clear why I think this is so great. I&#8217;m critical of a lot of performance art and have been part of an unappreciative audience. When I was younger and thought that yelling could actually make a band deviate from its set, I would try to get Slayer to play Spill the Blood. Unlike an awards show audience, I don&#8217;t think a stand-up comedy audience needs to &#8220;eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose this performance pits empathy for a defiant artist against empathy for expectant patrons. Kaufman&#8217;s act happens to be brave enough and defiant enough to win here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Metallica at the 1989 Grammys</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7oZyWt7pGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just footage of the performance. I couldn&#8217;t find something with shots of the audience.)</p>
<p>To provide some context, the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Billboard top 20</a> then was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>01. Look Away » Chicago<br />
02. My Prerogative » Bobby Brown<br />
03. Every Rose Has Its Thorn » Poison<br />
04. Straight Up » Paula Abdul<br />
05. Miss You Much » Janet Jackson<br />
06. Cold Hearted » Paula Abdul<br />
07. Wind Beneath My Wings » Bette Midler<br />
08. Girl You Know Its True » Milli Vanilli<br />
09. Baby, I Love Your Way-Freebird » Will To Power<br />
10. Giving You The Best That I Got » Anita Baker<br />
11. Right Here Waiting » Richard Marx<br />
12. Waiting For A Star To Fall » Boy Meets Girl<br />
13. Lost In Your Eyes » Debbie Gibson<br />
14. Don&#8217;t Wanna Lose You » Gloria Estefan<br />
15. Heaven » Warrant<br />
16. Girl I&#8217;m Gonna Miss You » Milli Vanilli<br />
17. The Look » Roxette<br />
18. She Drives Me Crazy » Fine Young Cannibals<br />
19. On Our Own » Bobby Brown<br />
20. Two Hearts » Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that was the world that the record industry celebrated, and that was the world of the Grammys.</p>
<p>In the other corner, Metallica had never been on commercial radio, much less on TV on a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; awards show like the Grammys. Before they began the long process of revealing their fallibility and humanness that started around 1991, they were perceived as something akin to a force, rather than as a group of musicians. Sort of like a comet. You might think a comet is awesome, but it is driven by forces outside of the control of man.</p>
<p>This was quite the collision. </p>
<p>Having been introduced to Metallica by the black album, I did not witness the Grammy performance live. When I did see and read about this in the nineties, I absolutely loved the audience reaction. Some of it thought it was novel and cheered, but there were plenty of Clive Davis types that were just stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect that, and they did not have a good time. </p>
<p>And as a guy that did not have a good time at all with the pop music that was hard to get away from back then, I liked that a lot.<br />

<p>You probably remember this, but just in case you don&#8217;t: This dinner is a yearly celebration held by the reporters that cover the White House. The president of the United States is there. No matter how atrocious he may be, the speakers and reporters at the dinner rib him gently and chum it up real good.</p>
<p>Colbert stood about <i>ten feet away</i> from President George W. Bush and just rained crushing bombs on him for half an hour. Iraq, an inability to accept facts, and the politically motivated leak of a CIA field agent&#8217;s identity were all brought up. Yup, uncomfortable, amazing stuff. This was party wrecking at the highest level of power, and it required serious perseverance in addition to bravery and cleverness. </p>

Rodriguez is blatantly (and excellently) provoking the racists that support SB-1070. However, this isn&#8217;t the first time this has been done.</p>
<p>A decade and half earlier, the <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#10" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_10?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Satanic, human-sacrificing,</a> <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#4" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_4?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">border crossing</a>, <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#5" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_5?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">drug dealing</a>, <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#3" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_3?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">headbangers</a> Brujer&#0236;a responded to California governor Pete Wilson&#8217;s passage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_187" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_187?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Proposition 187</a> with a song titled <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#1" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_1?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">Raza Odiada</a>.

<p>Back then, I was looking for the heaviest music possible. With that territory comes a lot of lyrics that really try to make you say &#8220;holy shit.&#8221; Very little of it did. </p>
<p>Death metal bands espousing the downfall of Christianity was like ranch dressing at a buffet. I tuned it out and listened to just the music. (Which was not necessarily a bad thing.) Black metal bands&#8217; flirtation with Nazism from the safety of their moms&#8217; basements in Norway was just pathetic. </p>
<p>Brujerìa cut through all of that and made me go &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; (Like a machete!) Fake or not, Satanic Mexican drug dealers were a scary idea to which people weren&#8217;t yet numb. It got my attention.</p>
<p><a href="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/05/brujeria_band.jpg"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/05/brujeria_band.jpg" alt="" title="brujeria_band" width="500" height="365" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26" /></a></p>
<p>They were novel and impressively crazy which could have been enough, but I liked that they stopped for a bit with Raza Odiada to make a good point in addition to their usual terrorizing. &#8220;Quien te va chingar mas no es Satanas,&#8221; de hecho.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If John McCain really wants to avoid getting outflanked by his challenger on the right, JD Hayworth, advocating that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20004108-503544.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20004108-503544.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">US Citizens be denied their Miranda rights</a> isn&#8217;t going to cut it. That&#8217;s like shooting the spot a target was at a second ago instead of shooting where it will be by the time your bullet travels far enough. </p>
<p>With his <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/04/poll-mccain-unpopular-back-home-in-arizona.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/04/poll-mccain-unpopular-back-home-in-arizona.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpolitics%2F');">disapproval rating at 55%</a>, there&#8217;s little room for limp-wristed bumbling like the Mirandizing condemnation or switching stances on immigration.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading, John McCain, listen up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<b>You need to speak out against robot marriage and the ENTIRE robosexual agenda.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Good luck, my friend.</p>
