<p>This scene is so over-the-top, yet it works so well. If you&#8217;ve ever felt like you&#8217;re being shut out of something unjustly, it&#8217;s incredibly resonant. It makes your insides go YEAAHHHH!</p>
<p>I look this up scene up probably a few times a year. I don&#8217;t know what, if any, constructive lessons it can teach (the movie as a whole imparts a depressing lesson about the futility of rage), but it just hits some spot. Defiance, even when it&#8217;s strategically detrimental, has some incalculable value in regard to feeling properly <i>right</i>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finished Craig Thompson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habibi-Craig-Thompson/dp/0375424148" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Habibi-Craig-Thompson/dp/0375424148?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Habibi</a> last night. I found it both sad and wonder-packed, a combination that is in itself kind of wondrous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge story about a girl, Dodola, in a poor Middle Eastern country. She escapes from a slave camp to a ship husk in the desert. She takes a fellow slave with her, who is an infant at the time. The infant is named Cham, namesake of the damned dark-skinned son of Noah.</p>
<p>Dodola renames him Habibi. They go through quite a bit.</p>
<p>The story flows around quite a few heavy issues, among them, child brides, slavery, prostitution, racism, sexual repression, familial/sexual role ambiguity, gender identity, poverty, and oligarchies. It notes them, lets them roll around in your head, but does not dwell on them. It does not pity its characters, as horrible as their situations sometimes are.</p>
<p>Dodola is well-read and knows many stories &#8211; tales from Arabic legend, the Quran, and Islamic mysticism &#8211; which she tells herself or Zam (Habibi&#8217;s nickname) when things are rough. The narrative focus gives these stories as much weight as much as Dodola&#8217;s and Zam&#8217;s reality. They are connected to their real problems, so they are not pure escapism as you might think. Rather, they are, perhaps, a more useful perspective than literal reality is.</p>
<p>Where and when they are is a mystery for most of the book. There&#8217;s some skipping around, chronologically, and many huge reveals of new settings. This, too, adds to that feeling of wonder that one might think would clash with the crushing things that happen to Dodola and Zam. (It does not.)</p>
<p>This book is illustrated meticulously. He adopted fully the intricacy and reverence for geometrical relationships and patterns of Islamic art. I think I was blown away every three pages. Ornate lattices, calligraphy, super detailed panels of packed with literal junk &#8211; all amazing. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7759645714_9dc956bc8c.jpg" alt="Pool" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/7759649694_40919c4477.jpg" alt="Door" /></p>
<p>But nothing is every confusing, a la the super busy cross-hatching tornados of early nineties superhero comics. It&#8217;s all strong, purposeful lines that know exactly what they want to emphasize, even when there are thousands of them.</p>
<p>I feel I should say, that while I&#8217;ve mentioned several times that the characters suffer a lot of cruelty and that the story doesn&#8217;t pity them, neither is it cruel to them, if that makes any sense. It is also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7759654626/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7759654626/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">not without humor</a>.</p>
<p>Incredible work. I&#8217;m glad I stumbled upon it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">The KLF at the BRIT Awards</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CDButf0go8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The KLF built a career on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">formulaically safe music</a>. So formulaic, in fact, that they wrote a detailed manual on how to make it. They knew they were making music whose prime characteristic was that chumps could easily digest it.<br />
<span id="more-61"></span><br />
By 1992, they decided they were done with it, so at the BRIT awards (an industry award show like the Grammys), they invited Extreme Noise Terror, a British grindcore band, to play a version of their hit 3 AM Eternal with them.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like audience received it rather well, so this isn&#8217;t a perfect example of the kind of party wrecking of which I&#8217;m thinking. Still, it&#8217;s a great instance of  people that are accustomed to getting what they want (and defining what others get) <i>not</i> getting what they want.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Andy Kaufman reading the Great Gatsby</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.43.26-AM.png" alt="" title="Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby." width="480" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts run by stand-up comedians lately, and I get the impression there&#8217;s immense pressure to connect and deliver. Kaufman got shows booked because of his role as Latka on the sitcom Taxi, and people were expecting for something sort of similar to that sort of comedy. Also, they were expecting stand-up comedy. Knowing this, Kaufman decided that what he&#8217;d rather do is read them the Great Gatsby. So he did, despite boos and disappointment. And of course, he did create comedy. Not for the people there, though, who were the ones putting the pressure on him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not completely clear why I think this is so great. I&#8217;m critical of a lot of performance art and have been part of an unappreciative audience. When I was younger and thought that yelling could actually make a band deviate from its set, I would try to get Slayer to play Spill the Blood. Unlike an awards show audience, I don&#8217;t think a stand-up comedy audience needs to &#8220;eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose this performance pits empathy for a defiant artist against empathy for expectant patrons. Kaufman&#8217;s act happens to be brave enough and defiant enough to win here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Metallica at the 1989 Grammys</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7oZyWt7pGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just footage of the performance. I couldn&#8217;t find something with shots of the audience.)</p>
<p>To provide some context, the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">Billboard top 20</a> then was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>01. Look Away » Chicago<br />
02. My Prerogative » Bobby Brown<br />
03. Every Rose Has Its Thorn » Poison<br />
04. Straight Up » Paula Abdul<br />
05. Miss You Much » Janet Jackson<br />
06. Cold Hearted » Paula Abdul<br />
07. Wind Beneath My Wings » Bette Midler<br />
08. Girl You Know Its True » Milli Vanilli<br />
09. Baby, I Love Your Way-Freebird » Will To Power<br />
10. Giving You The Best That I Got » Anita Baker<br />
11. Right Here Waiting » Richard Marx<br />
12. Waiting For A Star To Fall » Boy Meets Girl<br />
13. Lost In Your Eyes » Debbie Gibson<br />
14. Don&#8217;t Wanna Lose You » Gloria Estefan<br />
15. Heaven » Warrant<br />
16. Girl I&#8217;m Gonna Miss You » Milli Vanilli<br />
17. The Look » Roxette<br />
18. She Drives Me Crazy » Fine Young Cannibals<br />
19. On Our Own » Bobby Brown<br />
20. Two Hearts » Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that was the world that the record industry celebrated, and that was the world of the Grammys.</p>
<p>In the other corner, Metallica had never been on commercial radio, much less on TV on a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; awards show like the Grammys. Before they began the long process of revealing their fallibility and humanness that started around 1991, they were perceived as something akin to a force, rather than as a group of musicians. Sort of like a comet. You might think a comet is awesome, but it is driven by forces outside of the control of man.</p>
<p>This was quite the collision. </p>
<p>Having been introduced to Metallica by the black album, I did not witness the Grammy performance live. When I did see and read about this in the nineties, I absolutely loved the audience reaction. Some of it thought it was novel and cheered, but there were plenty of Clive Davis types that were just stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect that, and they did not have a good time. </p>
<p>And as a guy that did not have a good time at all with the pop music that was hard to get away from back then, I liked that a lot.<br />

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879#" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.49.59-AM.png" alt="" title="Colbert at the White House Correspondents&#039; Association Dinner" width="590" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></a></p>
<p>You probably remember this, but just in case you don&#8217;t: This dinner is a yearly celebration held by the reporters that cover the White House. The president of the United States is there. No matter how atrocious he may be, the speakers and reporters at the dinner rib him gently and chum it up real good.</p>
<p>Colbert stood about <i>ten feet away</i> from President George W. Bush and just rained crushing bombs on him for half an hour. Iraq, an inability to accept facts, and the politically motivated leak of a CIA field agent&#8217;s identity were all brought up. Yup, uncomfortable, amazing stuff. This was party wrecking at the highest level of power, and it required serious perseverance in addition to bravery and cleverness. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I picked up a graph paper notebook and some blank index cards. They were 37¢! (Back to school supply sales: Still somehow captivating.)</p>
<p>I already drew a dungeon in the notebook. Then, I drew some guys fighting.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know why grids inspire freehand drawing of figures that don&#8217;t seem to take advantage of grids, until a little while ago, when I found out about <a href="http://www.thegridsystem.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thegridsystem.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">grid-based design</a>. A lot of magazine and web page layouts that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a grid are actually rooted in grids. They impose a subconscious order that appeals to your brain. Dant-dant-dah! Maybe it does the same for freehand drawing.</p>
<p>The drawing turned out to be two drawings in one! </p>
<p>1. Guy that just passed guard and is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">establishing mount</a>/guy that&#8217;s bridging to escape mount.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/" title="Trying to bridge out of mount" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4870180098_7a986d5bc3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>2. Guy that&#8217;s trying to pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">guard</a>/guy that is setting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_(grappling)#Ground_work" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_grappling_Ground_work?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');">sweep</a> with his guard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/" title=Passing guard" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fart%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4869566873_7bb1577e3d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an accident that a drawing of one situation flipped over looks like a drawing of another situation, but I bet it&#8217;s not all that common when drawing grappling situations. </p>
<p>You know: martial arts and the yin yang and the glass half-empty and the Circle of Life and all that!</p>

<p>Bravest Ever is likely to bring you consistent sketch-satisfaction! She actually has a  a posting schedule, so disappearing for a month at a time is much less likely over there.</p>
<p>This is not to say you should leave Death Mountain! After all, we have <a href="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/06/Gibdo.gif">mummies</a> here.</p>
