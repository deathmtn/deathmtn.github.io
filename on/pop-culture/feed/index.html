			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/2417426,CST-NWS-SNEED22.article" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/2417426_CST-NWS-SNEED22.article?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">Apparently</a>, a famous hockey man named &#8220;Brent Sopel&#8221; is bringing the prized Stanley Cup to his local Gay Pride Parade. Judging by the reaction in the comments on that article, many hockey (and &#8220;hocky&#8221;) fans are upset by this.<br />
<img alt="" src="http://strangeherring.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/hayden-panettiere-stanley-cup-01.jpg" title="The Stanley Cup is purely a family affair." class="alignnone" width="400" height="265" /></p>
<p>Why? Well for one, the Cup&#8217;s presence at the parade may inspire gays to overrun and dominate the sport of hockey, the way they took over the sport of figure skating, back in 1971. The prized Borman Chalice, then the highest honor in figure skating, appeared at a Pride parade in San Francisco, and it was all downhill from there. Prior to that, figure skating had been the straight white male&#8217;s haven from turbulent (and tiresome) social change. A man could go down to the rink, enjoy a brew, and watch some men triple axle it up, secure in the faith that he was gazing at twirling buttocks which were <i>completely impenetrable</i>, like two iron bowling balls fused together in the manliest blacksmith fires of Germany.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.philross.com/images/Dual_Swings_Cropped.jpg" title="Soon, this blacksmith will take these balls to the forge to imbue them with impenetrability!" class="alignnone" width="454" height="637" /><br />
<span id="more-35"></span><br />
Additionally, it is said that all who touch the Cup are granted the legal right to same-sex marriage in any state &#8211; whether they&#8217;ve earned it or not &#8211; and that all women who drink liquids from it will be granted the right to vote in state &#8211; and possibly federal &#8211; elections. You definitely don&#8217;t want just anybody touching this thing.</p>
<p>Thus, the public is outraged, and as it often does, the outrage has tragically damaged their ability to spell as well as intelligently express thoughts in written or oral form. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now that I&#8217;ve cleanly explained the outrage at Cup&#8217;s appearance at the parade, we can discuss the greater issue here: Should there even be such a thing as a Gay Pride Parade at all?</p>
<p>You might think, now what is wrong with gay people showing their pride, in parade form no less? After all, even the mighty German blacksmiths, the manliest and sternest of us all, have parades.</p>
<p>Yes, I thought much the same as you. Until the other day, when I saw the following (paraphrased) comment on a friend&#8217;s Facebook status:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;m all for gays having rights, but why does the Pride parade have to have so many men in thongs and pasties and chaps and all manner of flamboyant skin-showing attire? It&#8217;s not very family-friendly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Science/Images/gay-pride-parade-toronto.jpg" title="What would manly German blacksmiths think?" class="alignnone" width="320" height="348" /><br />
Indeed. How can you let a child see a man with pasties on? What if the boy goes home and makes his own construction paper pasties? And how will you explain to him why these men have carefully styled hair?</p>
<p>Because they may spark awkward conversations with children, the Pride parades should all be shut down. Case closed. However, it occurred to me that we can&#8217;t just stop there. There&#8217;s another class of not very family-friendly places still on the loose: Beaches.</p>
<p>I was at one beach at which numerous &#8220;ladies&#8221; were barely covering their upper private areas with thin strips of cloth. Due to the prevalence of this &#8220;bikini&#8221; top-wear, a child could see <i>40-80%</i> of each indecent bosom. Their lower and rear private areas were also radiating indecency. Exposed upper thighs were everywhere.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.worst-city.com/pictures/bikini-beach-girls-skimpy-bra-swimming-costume-hot-native-girls-white-polka-dot-60s-70s.jpg" title="Yeah, *you* try explaining these whores of Babylon to young Dylan." class="alignnone" width="400" height="355" /></p>
<p>Why did these women have to do this, knowing that several families were around? Did they revel in making decent families uncomfortable? Was it to seduce the children? I don&#8217;t know, but I do know that there were 8-10 families there, and they were jaw-dropping in their misconduct. They <i>didn&#8217;t even attempt to shield their children</i> from these harlots. The families took an astonishingly relaxed attitude toward the whole debacle. It was as if it was just a (non-indecent) day at the beach for them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I called <a href="http://www.state.il.us/dcfs/index.shtml" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.state.il.us/dcfs/index.shtml?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">DCFS</a> on every single one of them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the lesson here is that there are some things in the world at large that some parents feel are awkward to discuss with their children. Thus, it&#8217;s only fair to put an end to all of these things.</p>

Rodriguez is blatantly (and excellently) provoking the racists that support SB-1070. However, this isn&#8217;t the first time this has been done.</p>
<p>A decade and half earlier, the <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#10" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_10?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">Satanic, human-sacrificing,</a> <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#4" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_4?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">border crossing</a>, <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#5" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_5?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">drug dealing</a>, <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#3" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_3?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">headbangers</a> Brujer&#0236;a responded to California governor Pete Wilson&#8217;s passage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_187" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_187?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">Proposition 187</a> with a song titled <a href="http://darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html#1" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/darklyrics.com/lyrics/brujeria/razaodiada.html_1?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fpop-culture%2F');">Raza Odiada</a>.

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, I was looking for the heaviest music possible. With that territory comes a lot of lyrics that really try to make you say &#8220;holy shit.&#8221; Very little of it did. </p>
<p>Death metal bands espousing the downfall of Christianity was like ranch dressing at a buffet. I tuned it out and listened to just the music. (Which was not necessarily a bad thing.) Black metal bands&#8217; flirtation with Nazism from the safety of their moms&#8217; basements in Norway was just pathetic. </p>
<p>Brujerìa cut through all of that and made me go &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; (Like a machete!) Fake or not, Satanic Mexican drug dealers were a scary idea to which people weren&#8217;t yet numb. It got my attention.</p>
<p><a href="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/05/brujeria_band.jpg"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2010/05/brujeria_band.jpg" alt="" title="brujeria_band" width="500" height="365" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26" /></a></p>
<p>They were novel and impressively crazy which could have been enough, but I liked that they stopped for a bit with Raza Odiada to make a good point in addition to their usual terrorizing. &#8220;Quien te va chingar mas no es Satanas,&#8221; de hecho.</p>
