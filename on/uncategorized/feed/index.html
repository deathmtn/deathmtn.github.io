<p>It got me thinking about how ill-defined consciousness is and why we care so much about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I think consciousness is important, but other times, I feel it&#8217;s  narcissistic for us &#8220;higher&#8221; order organic systems to make a big deal out of consciousness.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re systems that sustain ourselves for a period of decades. When these systems operate, the layers of reactions that are furthest from outside the system manifest as consciousness. </p>
<p>When we observe other systems that take actions in response to stimuli in a way that is similar to ours, we assume that those other systems work in a similar way and assign it the status of being conscious.</p>
<p>When a system such as, say,</p>
<ul>
<li>A plant</li>
<li>A unicellular organism</li>
<li>A virus</li>
<li>A tire fire, or</li>
<li>A star</li>
</ul>
<p>does not respond to stimuli in a way similar to ours, we say that it is not conscious.</p>
<p>However, they have their own ways of sustaining themselves, and they have their own particular internal tensions and reactions. How can we be sure that these are really that different from what we have labeled consciousness?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently packed my old blog, Notes of Chaos, into a PDF. While slowly re-reading it on my iPad, I came across this review of Autofac.</p>
<p>Short version: If you want to know how it feels to debug a program or hack something, read Autofac.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Capturing realistic technical struggle</strong><br />
2002-06-11 03:47:16<br />
￼<br />
I read Philip K. Dick&#8217;s Autofac last night.</p>
<p>The Autofacs (autonomous factories) were designed to get humanity back on its feet in the event of a nuclear holocaust (&#8220;Total Global Conflict&#8221;), which happened five years ago in this story. They do this by gathering natural resources and then manufacturing and delivering all of the goods that people need.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for humanity, there is a huge bug in the Autofacs: they harvest all of the natural resources and will back away from them only when human productivity matches that of the Autofacs&#8217;. That level of productivity is kinda hard for humanity to achieve while the Autofacs are taking 100% of the resources. Thus, humans must depend completely upon the Autofacs unless they can be shut down.<br />
<span id="more-81"></span><br />
It&#8217;s how they try to stop the Autofacs that&#8217;s interesting. They start by thinking of stimuli that that might throw it off, then systematically run through each of them. They feel that it is hopeless, but they try these tests anyway. And one of the tests does get results.</p>
<p>The humans tell the Autofac that the milk it manufactures is &#8220;pizzled.&#8221; The Autofac doesn&#8217;t know what &#8220;pizzled&#8221; means, so it sends out an agent to get the definition and resolve the complaint. This is a chance for the would-be Autofac hackers to influence the Autofac, to get it to behave the way want, at least in some small way. Perhaps even expose other hooks into Autofac. The heroes are overjoyed by this little triumph.<br />
Of course, when the agent comes to investigate the &#8220;pizzled&#8221; milk, they lose patience and botch the opportunity. Really, mistakes in such a situation are perfectly understandable. The humans had no idea what the agent was going to say or how it would respond to them. Yet, it was so important to make something of the opportunity because it was so damned hard to set up.</p>
<p>This is exactly how I have felt when working on those especially bizarre bugs that offer little or no clues. Looking at the most likely source code doesn&#8217;t help. No one else seems to have hints. Often, bugs in this confounding class are caused by factors outside the product. In any case, you have no good place to start, so you just have to start stabbing. You may be stabbing for a long time without hitting anything, and it is hard not to second-guess yourself.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the The Minority Report and Other Classic Stories by Philip K. Dick, James Tiptree Jr.&#8221; says that Dick is not technical. She says that &#8220;he probably knows what happens when you plug in a lamp and turn it on, but beyond that, there is little evidence of either technology or science.&#8221; Yet somehow, Dick has captured very well the sense of desperation and the struggle to maintain patience and rationalness which arise in technical struggles that involve a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>I have not seen that done in any other story. And he does it in such clean and simple language.
</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Katt:</b> I have never read any Lovecraft.</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> He&#8217;s a pretty bad writer, but some of his stories are great.</p>
<p><b>Katt:</b> I get the impression they&#8217;re all like &#8220;Dear readers, I was in Providence for fishing and science, and I learned of the unspeakable horror of the beast known as Harnlthyanahggh.</p>
<p><b>Katt:</b> He is a blind dead lizard man with tentacles who lives under the sea and makes ominous BLORP noises. One day, when his eternal Game Boy finally runs out of battery power, he will eat the coastline.</p>
<p><b>Katt:</b> In the deepest reaches of space, there is a hole that leads back to a drainpipe in Queens. Here is where all the antimatter lives, and the Marlaghthtrangh lies eating popsicles.</p>
