			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That was a great fight. Any fight involving two people with perfect proprioception is bound to be. But the outcome bummed me out more than I thought it would.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t read on if you haven&#8217;t seen the fight yet.</p>
<p><span id="more-79"></span>I already know that skill just isn&#8217;t enough in a lot of situations. But this fight seemed to want make extra-sure that I knew that. </p>
<p>That first round showed that BJ&#8217;s just better (what I think of as &#8220;better&#8221;, at least) than Nick. He slipped and tagged, then took Nick down and took his back, smoothly rolling through Nick&#8217;s struggling. BJ was slicker, faster, and able to circumvent a reach advantage. That is a rare magic, I think.</p>
<p>But after that, he got tired; he got less persistent; and somehow, he ended up getting pelted for two rounds. Some of this was conditioning and concentration, but it <i>felt</i> like it was more a matter of pure determination. Diaz was completely undeterred by quick counters and positional domination. He looked and moved exactly the same as he did before and after setbacks like that. He just wouldn&#8217;t stop pouring it on.</p>
<p>(Although less amazing than Penn, Diaz is extremely skilled in all major areas of mixed martial arts. I don&#8217;t want to give the impression he is a one-dimensional zombie. I just happen to believe his unrelenting aggression is what gets him the victories.)</p>
<p>So, why would I be crestfallen by BJ losing, then? In terms of personal conduct, they are both prone to making unethical accusations. But I usually excuse Nick because I partially buy into the idea that he&#8217;s kinda crazy and because he does it so unintentionally hilariously.</p>
<p>I think it may be because I&#8217;m conditioned to root for the slicker, more skillful competitor, whatever the nature of the contest. After all, as a relatively smart guy that&#8217;s not large, that&#8217;s with whom I&#8217;m supposed to identify, right? Quick and clever vanquishing the brutish and less quick.</p>
<p>But as I have gotten older and come across cleverer and cleverer people with increasing frequency, I have had to question how frequently I&#8217;m on that side of the equation. Certainly, I have had my (not necessarily bad) brutish moments. I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten through more big problems through force and persistence than with ingenuity. </p>
<p>Perhaps this ideal, then, is outmoded for me. No longer that useful. And so, I really should take heart that if you&#8217;re close enough in skill, unrelenting bullheadedness can close the gap. I should, in fact, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-tPXlNdlg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-tPXlNdlg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">not be scared of this, homie</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, I should let up on assigning myself archetypes, but that&#8217;s not something I do consciously.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/03/ask-korean-news-north-korean-special.html" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/03/ask-korean-news-north-korean-special.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">Ask a Korean</a> translated part of a fascinating interview with a North Korean Special Forces commando that had defected to South Korea.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Im Cheon-Yong (45) was a captain of North Korean Special Forces. He is relatively short &#8212; not quite 170 cm [TK: 5' 7"] &#8212; but had unusually large fists, reminiscent of a cartoon character. The fact that this reporter met an officer of North Korean military&#8217;s special combat unit became even more real after he explained, &#8220;I practiced punching several thousand times a day.&#8221; His handshake was firm and heavy.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The training for special combat as told by Mr. Im was harsh as expected, and some parts beyond imagination. The training begins on 5 a.m. The fundamental of the training is to turn the entire body into steely firmness, and the basic part is training the fist.</p>
<p>Mr. Im said, &#8220;You would wrap a tree trunk with ropes, and keep punching it. You throw 5000 punches day and night &#8212; do that for a month, the inside of your fist swells up until you can barely curl your fingers.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Then you open a tin can and set it up on a stand. You keep punching the sharp part. When your hand turns into mush with blood and pus, you start punching a pile of salt. Repeat it, and your hands become like a stone.&#8221; Mr. Im explained, &#8220;You punch the salt so that the salt would prevent the hand from rotting away with the blood.&#8221; According to Mr. Im, with the hand trained like this &#8220;you can easily break 20 sheets of cement blocks, and you can kill a person with three punches.&#8221; His hands would naturally make a fist throughout the interview. This reporter had to respectfully ask that he unclench his fist during the interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember hearing about this kind of thing as a kid. (I was told the rumor was that North Korean special forces could climb brick walls using just their fingers.) Despite the evils of North Korea, I thought it would be incredibly cool if such legendary soldiers existed. Now I&#8217;m an adult, and I know they exist, yet I find it sad.</p>
<p>The truth is that this insane training is sadly not that relevant. This is a time in which their opponents will very likely be armed, and those that won&#8217;t be would be easy to beat up anyway, without iron fist kung fu. It&#8217;s not even that relevant in unarmed combat &#8211; as Mr. Im probably knows, punching is not viable or possible in some phases of combat. Some South Korean bodyguard could clinch up with him, and the years of tree-punching go out the window.</p>
<p>Having these rock-like fists is more convenient than picking up a rock or blackjack, but it is still not worth it. That effort and time spent punching trees (and recovering from punching trees and losing fine motor skills) could be spent on other aspects of hand-to-hand combat, or better yet &#8211; armed combat or tactics. Even learning about South Korean government and society could help them be better assassins more effectively than clubbing their hands.</p>
<p>This is such a tragic waste of incredible willpower and human potential, even in the context of the horrible field of assassination. What could these guys be doing if they weren&#8217;t lead by childish morons?</p>
<p>These commandos are pushing human limits in order to do something that is largely archaic and useless. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re not the only citizens of North Korea doing so, and that is just another horrific aspect of life in that country.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I picked up a graph paper notebook and some blank index cards. They were 37¢! (Back to school supply sales: Still somehow captivating.)</p>
<p>I already drew a dungeon in the notebook. Then, I drew some guys fighting.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know why grids inspire freehand drawing of figures that don&#8217;t seem to take advantage of grids, until a little while ago, when I found out about <a href="http://www.thegridsystem.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thegridsystem.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">grid-based design</a>. A lot of magazine and web page layouts that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a grid are actually rooted in grids. They impose a subconscious order that appeals to your brain. Dant-dant-dah! Maybe it does the same for freehand drawing.</p>
<p>The drawing turned out to be two drawings in one! </p>
<p>1. Guy that just passed guard and is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">establishing mount</a>/guy that&#8217;s bridging to escape mount.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/" title="Trying to bridge out of mount" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4870180098_7a986d5bc3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>2. Guy that&#8217;s trying to pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">guard</a>/guy that is setting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_(grappling)#Ground_work" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_grappling_Ground_work?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');">sweep</a> with his guard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/" title=Passing guard" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmartial-arts%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4869566873_7bb1577e3d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an accident that a drawing of one situation flipped over looks like a drawing of another situation, but I bet it&#8217;s not all that common when drawing grappling situations. </p>
<p>You know: martial arts and the yin yang and the glass half-empty and the Circle of Life and all that!</p>
