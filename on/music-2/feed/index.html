			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally saw Iron Maiden tonight. They tour only every other year, and they play the humongous venues that foment irritation. So, I&#8217;ve never been.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7276/7453001784_c359a29d6c_z.jpg" alt="Sea of Madness" /></p>
<p>But they are not going to be playing or living forever, so you really should see them. I&#8217;m glad I did. Despite the many obstacles to my enjoyment I hit en route to Maiden&#8217;s performance, I ended up having an ecstatic time.</p>
<p>They were spotlighting stuff from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which is not my favorite Maiden album. Yet they totally sold all these long-ass progressive ragas just on the power of their sound, which is very vivid and very robust live. They made me believe that anything would sound good coming out of them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recite a set list, but here&#8217;s the songs I remember them playing, in approximate order:<br />
<span id="more-98"></span><br />
<i>Moonchild</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know the song well, but it was exciting. Very nice build-up. I shot a few clips of the show here and there. They sound bad, as expected, yet they&#8217;re surprisingly intelligible. I guess I was far back enough. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453118278/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453118278/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Here&#8217;s one of the opener.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><i>The Evil That Men Do</i><br />
<i>Two Minutes to Midnight</i><br />
<i>The Prisoner</i></p>
<p><i>The Trooper</i></p>
<blockquote><p>The harmonies really breathed and felt richly &#8220;wavy&#8221; like they were maybe playing them a bit rubato. At the same time, the song seemed to whiz by. I was on the edge of every note, headbanging like nuts, and it seemed like it was over in two minutes.</p>
<p>Also, Bruce went the whole nine yards. While wailing about Russian guns, he waved the Union Jack and wore the traditional red suit of the British. Throughout the show, he was running about and climbing all over things. It was not unlike Method Man&#8217;s stage craziness.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Number of the Beast</i></p>
<blockquote><p>So ridiculously exciting. Certainly, part of it is yelling 6! 6-6! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453106342/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453106342/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Here&#8217;s a little video of that.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i></p>
<p><i>Afraid to Shoot Strangers</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Bruce dedicated this to America and Charlton Heston. I had never heard this song, but it ruled. Lots of abrupt tempo changes, which they played off as no big deal, and so did not seem at all song-breaking. I&#8217;m going to have to check it out.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Fear of the Dark</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I sang along with this loud enough to hear myself and realized I sounded like Anton Maiden. Kept going anyway! Such is the strength of its anthemic call.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Can I Play with Madness?</i><br />
<i>Wasted Years</i><br />
<i>Iron Maiden</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Encore&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Aces High</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I was not surprised by the melodrama that is the encore, but I was surprised it was this. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453098836/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453098836/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">That Churchill intro is so goddamned epic</a> that it makes the first fast riff in the song seem ten times bigger. Kinda lost my shit over this one.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Run to the Hills</i></p>
<blockquote><p>
For years, I heard Metallica&#8217;s parody of this intro riff in my head every time I heard the real one. Even after I came to like the song overall, I didn&#8217;t think too much of that riff. Tonight, they brought it to life, and it sounded anything but silly. </p>
<p>Throughout the show, you could tell Bruce Dickinson is a great singer, but here, you really felt like he was commanding perfectly a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>Also, remember that episode of Beavis and Butt-head in which they get taken to jail to be &#8220;Scared Straight,&#8221; but end up singing &#8220;Run to the Hills&#8221; with some inmates? Quite a few guys there looked like those inmates (and quite a few didn&#8217;t, of course).
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</i><br />
<i>Running Free</i></p>
<p><b>Other Notes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Iron Maiden is a very &#8220;ringing&#8221; band. The vocals ring, the bass clangs, and the vocals sing. They&#8217;re also very punchy, but something is always ringing. The metal bands I listened to most in my formative years favored crunching, dense percussiveness over extended reverberating when it came down to it, so it&#8217;s striking to me.
</li>
<li>
Steve Harris is the most commanding bass player I&#8217;ve heard. First off, he&#8217;s loud enough in the mix that he easily cuts through three guitars. Then, he tends to play riffs that are like metal rhythm guitar riffs, and the guitars sometimes end up playing more melodic and less percussive stuff. It&#8217;s not important that the bass lead, and it&#8217;s not possible at certain tempos, but it is salient.
</li>
<li>
As I mentioned above, the guitar harmonies seemed to flourish live. I wonder if it&#8217;s the third guitar. (Janick Gers, their third guitarist, did not record on their older, classic albums.)
</li>
<li>
If you&#8217;ve ever wanted an opportunity to sing &#8220;Whoahhoahoah!&#8221; a lot, a Maiden show is probably just as good for this as a Misfits show.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">The KLF at the BRIT Awards</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CDButf0go8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The KLF built a career on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">formulaically safe music</a>. So formulaic, in fact, that they wrote a detailed manual on how to make it. They knew they were making music whose prime characteristic was that chumps could easily digest it.<br />
<span id="more-61"></span><br />
By 1992, they decided they were done with it, so at the BRIT awards (an industry award show like the Grammys), they invited Extreme Noise Terror, a British grindcore band, to play a version of their hit 3 AM Eternal with them.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like audience received it rather well, so this isn&#8217;t a perfect example of the kind of party wrecking of which I&#8217;m thinking. Still, it&#8217;s a great instance of  people that are accustomed to getting what they want (and defining what others get) <i>not</i> getting what they want.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Andy Kaufman reading the Great Gatsby</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.43.26-AM.png" alt="" title="Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby." width="480" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts run by stand-up comedians lately, and I get the impression there&#8217;s immense pressure to connect and deliver. Kaufman got shows booked because of his role as Latka on the sitcom Taxi, and people were expecting for something sort of similar to that sort of comedy. Also, they were expecting stand-up comedy. Knowing this, Kaufman decided that what he&#8217;d rather do is read them the Great Gatsby. So he did, despite boos and disappointment. And of course, he did create comedy. Not for the people there, though, who were the ones putting the pressure on him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not completely clear why I think this is so great. I&#8217;m critical of a lot of performance art and have been part of an unappreciative audience. When I was younger and thought that yelling could actually make a band deviate from its set, I would try to get Slayer to play Spill the Blood. Unlike an awards show audience, I don&#8217;t think a stand-up comedy audience needs to &#8220;eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose this performance pits empathy for a defiant artist against empathy for expectant patrons. Kaufman&#8217;s act happens to be brave enough and defiant enough to win here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Metallica at the 1989 Grammys</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7oZyWt7pGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just footage of the performance. I couldn&#8217;t find something with shots of the audience.)</p>
<p>To provide some context, the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Billboard top 20</a> then was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>01. Look Away » Chicago<br />
02. My Prerogative » Bobby Brown<br />
03. Every Rose Has Its Thorn » Poison<br />
04. Straight Up » Paula Abdul<br />
05. Miss You Much » Janet Jackson<br />
06. Cold Hearted » Paula Abdul<br />
07. Wind Beneath My Wings » Bette Midler<br />
08. Girl You Know Its True » Milli Vanilli<br />
09. Baby, I Love Your Way-Freebird » Will To Power<br />
10. Giving You The Best That I Got » Anita Baker<br />
11. Right Here Waiting » Richard Marx<br />
12. Waiting For A Star To Fall » Boy Meets Girl<br />
13. Lost In Your Eyes » Debbie Gibson<br />
14. Don&#8217;t Wanna Lose You » Gloria Estefan<br />
15. Heaven » Warrant<br />
16. Girl I&#8217;m Gonna Miss You » Milli Vanilli<br />
17. The Look » Roxette<br />
18. She Drives Me Crazy » Fine Young Cannibals<br />
19. On Our Own » Bobby Brown<br />
20. Two Hearts » Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that was the world that the record industry celebrated, and that was the world of the Grammys.</p>
<p>In the other corner, Metallica had never been on commercial radio, much less on TV on a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; awards show like the Grammys. Before they began the long process of revealing their fallibility and humanness that started around 1991, they were perceived as something akin to a force, rather than as a group of musicians. Sort of like a comet. You might think a comet is awesome, but it is driven by forces outside of the control of man.</p>
<p>This was quite the collision. </p>
<p>Having been introduced to Metallica by the black album, I did not witness the Grammy performance live. When I did see and read about this in the nineties, I absolutely loved the audience reaction. Some of it thought it was novel and cheered, but there were plenty of Clive Davis types that were just stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect that, and they did not have a good time. </p>
<p>And as a guy that did not have a good time at all with the pop music that was hard to get away from back then, I liked that a lot.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>You probably remember this, but just in case you don&#8217;t: This dinner is a yearly celebration held by the reporters that cover the White House. The president of the United States is there. No matter how atrocious he may be, the speakers and reporters at the dinner rib him gently and chum it up real good.</p>
<p>Colbert stood about <i>ten feet away</i> from President George W. Bush and just rained crushing bombs on him for half an hour. Iraq, an inability to accept facts, and the politically motivated leak of a CIA field agent&#8217;s identity were all brought up. Yup, uncomfortable, amazing stuff. This was party wrecking at the highest level of power, and it required serious perseverance in addition to bravery and cleverness. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently participated in <a href="http://hmtpng.com" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/hmtpng.com?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Hometaping</a>. Hometaping is one of those &#8220;do something in a month&#8221; projects. It&#8217;s like National Novel Writing Month, in that it&#8217;s held in November, and like RPM, in that it&#8217;s about making an album. I attempted this last year and failed, although I did get one song out of it, which is one more than I would have written otherwise.</p>
<p>This year, I finished a group of songs that could arguably called an album. <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">You can stream or download it here.</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only 19 minutes, but there&#8217;s seven fairly complete songs. And in the process of writing these songs, I did a handful of improvisations that were fun, even if not all of them made it on the album. (Two of them did.) I didn&#8217;t complete every song I started, either, but I did beat the expectations I had at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>While making this album, I learned a lot of things! According to <a href="http://asianniceguy.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/asianniceguy.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">this guy</a>, life is essentially about three things: Living, loving, and learning. So, I think we can all agree: It is fairly good that I learned.</p>
<p>A lot of what I learned I already knew. (And a lot of what I learned, <i>you</i> already knew.) As strange as that may sound, knowing isn&#8217;t the same as learning. Often, learning is not an on/off kind of thing. Some people read about something and instantly absorb it. Not me, though. I usually have to bump into the problem that the solution solves and flail at it uselessly in my own way before accepting the solution.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So. These things I learned (again) while making this album, and I was glad to learn them!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Even though I don&#8217;t listen to albums as albums very much any more, albums as a unit of work are still useful.</b></p>
<p>I tend to give a new album one or two listens. After that, its songs are absorbed into my sea of music and will pop up at random, disassociated with its album-mates. Every so often, I will hear a song on shuffle, then seek the album. But even then, I might not listen to them in order. I know some people that do still listen to music as albums, but with the way Kids These Days are going, the concept of the album as unit of art to be consumed as a whole is going to find less and less purchase.</p>
<p>As a unit of work, however, I find the album to still be a strong idea. I&#8217;m accustomed to working on one song at a time. During the making of this album, there was some very useful momentum. I didn&#8217;t have to warm up. Buying in bulk is good stuff, even in music writing, it seems. I ended up with 7+ songs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the number of songs I&#8217;ve made each year. (This chart leaves off the many, many noise improvisations I did around 2003.)</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=0:|1996|1997|1998|1999|2000|2001|2002|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010&#038;chxp=0,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010&#038;chxr=0,1996,2010,1|1,0,12&#038;chxs=0,676767,8,0,l,676767&#038;chxt=x,y&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=300x200&#038;cht=bvs&#038;chd=t:2,6,9,3,1,4,4,5,2,2,8,1,0,1,12&#038;chds=0,12&#038;chma=|0,260&#038;chtt=Songs+completed+per+year" alt="Chart" /><br />
<span id="more-49"></span><br />
Heh, so, now that I&#8217;ve put together that chart, I realize that it undermines my point a little bit. Data! Still, despite the spike at 2006, 2010 had the most completed songs of all time. (<i>All time.</i>) And the relative quality of these songs is a bit higher than the pre-2006 songs, on average. Things would be even more dramatic if I was able to graph out songs completed each month. I think it&#8217;s clear that albums get more songs made.</p>
<p>(Oh, re: 2006: Two of those eight songs were done for contests. So, some non-intrinsic motivation helped a little there, too.)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Finishing a song involves more than you think it will.</b></p>
<p>I hear the &#8220;the last 10% is 90% of the work&#8221; cliche a lot about all sorts of projects. I&#8217;ve also experienced it a few times. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve truly taken it to heart, yet. Someday!</p>
<p>At various points during November, I felt that a song was &#8220;mostly done&#8221;. Maybe it needed one more melody or the drums needed to be adjusted, or it just needed final mixing. In all cases that little extra touch took a while. The last additions to a song have to fit to the constraints of what&#8217;s already there (unless you&#8217;re willing to redo a lot) and so they often take longer to come up with than the parts that came before it.</p>
<p>And mixing &#8211; mixing involves repeated listening and trial and error, which is inherently time-consuming, even if it is a more passive activity than composing or playing.<br />
 &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. I enjoy mixing.</b></p>
<p>That said, mixing is a good time. I&#8217;m not saying that because I&#8217;m great at it. I just find mixing very absorbing and entertaining. It is, essentially, listening to music. You listen to the music, make your hypothesis about what&#8217;s wrong with it, make your changes based on that hypothesis, then listen again. So, I guess it&#8217;s also like science.</p>
<p>I had not explicitly realized that I enjoyed mixing before. From a pure enjoyment standpoint, I like it as much as composing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Perspective is easily lost while mixing.</b></p>
<p>You know how when you look at a word for a long time, it starts to look weird and not like the word at all? Something similar can happen when you spend a long time mixing. As you listen to the same thing again and again, your brain might start to tune parts of it out. Then, the next day, as you&#8217;re listening to the mix in your car, you&#8217;re shocked that it has an obvious flaw.</p>
<p>For this album, I often couldn&#8217;t help doing all the mixing in one go because there wasn&#8217;t that much time left after I had recorded it. Ideally, though, I wouldn&#8217;t try to mix things all in one day. I&#8217;d fiddle with things a bit each day on each song, getting fresh perspective for each session. Now that I think about it, I could have done this to an extent with this album. Instead of trying to hammer a song into ship shape once all of its parts were recorded, I could have done some initial mixing, switched to composing or recording a different song, then come back to roughly mixed songs for finer mixing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. My music ego is more fragile than I thought.</b></p>
<p>I had a big &#8220;what was I thinking?&#8221; moment while listening to the previous day&#8217;s mix of a song that was perhaps the worst of its kind that I can remember. I had a freakin&#8217; great time putting the song together and felt great about it the previous night.</p>
<p>During this drive, I was crushed. What is the point of working hard on something, good time or not, if you turn out shit? And how can one&#8217;s judgment from just the previous night be so much worse than it is the next day?</p>
<p>Of course, this was an overreaction. It was not that bad; I just wasn&#8217;t feeling the glow that I felt the previous night. That night, I fixed the problems that I had noticed in the morning, and it was fine again.</p>
<p>The first time you hear one of your ideas expressed, you may be more taken with it than you would normally. Getting too attached to that glow is trouble.</p>
<p>Usually, I keep in mind that what I&#8217;m making at the moment could very well be hated by me in two years. This has happened enough times to be an established pattern. I try to prevent that from dampening my enjoyment, but I use it to temper my expectations. Most of the time.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s good to stay aware, to a degree, that your emotions will ebb and flow as you work, and to not tie them too closely to your worth as a musician.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. Shit you make up on the spot can be just as good as a composition you&#8217;ve been refining for weeks.</b></p>
<p>Three of the seven songs on the album were composed on the spot.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Crab, Why Do You Smoke?</a> turned out well. Its three riffs were written in the half hour before they were recorded. I had written several riffs the night before, but some of them didn&#8217;t mesh well with each other, it was really hard to come up with drum parts to fit others, and some of them just sucked. </p>
<p>I tossed them and wrote more. I liked one. The others, I thought, well, that&#8217;s OK at best, but hey, this is Hometaping. The level of enthusiasm continued during the recording. When I played them back, they sounded pretty good. Perspective!</p>
<p>The acoustic pieces were written in an even shorter time &#8211; maybe fifteen minutes each. They weren&#8217;t played very tightly, either, as you can hear. They are the songs that dip into the amateur zone. Yet, I think they work.</p>
<p>You need to sit down and just start working sometimes, and good will come of it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7. Playing an acoustic and singing along to it is effective.</b></p>
<p>This kind of playing doesn&#8217;t fit my self-image in some ways. I think of myself first as a composer, then a guitar player. The electric kind, and not without distortion. I sing because it&#8217;s expedient.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;ve fiddled much more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQ-Xg_MS3k" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQ-Xg_MS3k&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">acoustic</a> in the past year than electric. To play the electric (or as I think of it &#8220;regular kind&#8221;) guitar, I need to:</p>
<p>- Plug in the guitar.<br />
- Find a pick.<br />
- Turn on the amp.<br />
- Turn on the POD.</p>
<p>To play the acoustic, I need to:</p>
<p>- Grab the acoustic.</p>
<p>If my time spent in software has taught me anything, it&#8217;s that tiny extra steps can really deter people from bothering with something. People are lazy. I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;ve never really been able to play and sing at the same time. Sometime last year, I just started doing it without even thinking about it. I&#8217;m not sure what clicked.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s nice about writing in this manner is that:</p>
<p>1. You are writing two parts at once.<br />
2. You know the parts fit.<br />
3. You end up writing a vocal line you know you can sing.<br />
4. There is not going to be a problem with establishing a natural vibe.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. Don&#8217;t write lyrics your singing can&#8217;t cash, or something like that.</b></p>
<p>There was one song for which I wrote some lyrics that were clever but were also very wordy. I was counting on myself to be able to be able to sing a syllable almost every beat, without a whole lot of rest. I did it, but crappily, and it detracted from the song. That song ended up being an instrumental.</p>
<p>Crab, Why Do You Smoke? originally had far more words. However, growling takes a lot out of you, and so does shouting. I would have had to sing like goddamn Tom Araya to get all that stuff in. Cleverness and wordplay are great, but I&#8217;m not a rapper. I don&#8217;t need to be a verbal acrobat, and I need to keep that in mind when I write lyrics.</p>
<p>This and the acoustic songs are making me rethinking my devotion to my riff-first process. I&#8217;ve found it easier to come up with a guitar part to fit with existing parts than it come up with vocals to go over some weird riff. I&#8217;m going to try to do guitars last a bit more often.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Having peers working on something similar is encouraging.</b></p>
<p>Like many of these lessons, this is kind of a &#8216;duh&#8217; thing, but I&#8217;ve never had peers composing at the same time. <a href="http://thelearnedfangirl.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/thelearnedfangirl.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">Keidra</a> did Hometaping <a href="http://soundcloud.com/keidra" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/keidra?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmusic-2%2F');">as well</a>, and she posted about her progress. It was really inspiring to know she was digging away at an album, too. My friend Miranda also recorded a song response to one of my songs, which was encouraging. Katt stepped in to do the intro vocals on This Fried Chicken when mine weren&#8217;t really working out, and so I felt even more invested in that song.</p>
<p>Generally, I don&#8217;t have peers or collaborators when writing music. In high school I had a project &#8220;band&#8221;, but most of my interaction with them consisted of haranguing them to get together to practice, learn songs, and/or buy instruments. We didn&#8217;t even get to writing songs. Since then, because I was largely uninterested in being in a band, I haven&#8217;t met anyone that actively wrote songs. Well, outside of people from online music communities. And most of those people were far from encouraging.</p>
<p>This lesson doesn&#8217;t really have much of a usable takeaway, given that whether or not you have colleagues in composition isn&#8217;t really a choice, but I like knowing it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. I react well to editing-style work and short feedback cycles.</b></p>
<p>I forgot this about myself. When I get to see what my changes are doing to my work I sink right into it. Every aspect of music production affords this. Photoshopping works the same way.</p>
<p>I work as a programmer, and sometimes you get to see the immediate effects of your changes, but oft times you have to build a few layers or break down a few layers to see any effect. There&#8217;s techniques you can use to shorten the feedback cycle as much as possible, but they don&#8217;t apply to everything. And sometimes you have to work on something in you are not emotionally invested, regardless of the length of the feedback cycle.</p>
<p>It feels good to concentrate for long periods of time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>11. Making music should be a regular part of life.</b></p>
<p>I was concerned about the amount of time that making an album in a month would eat up. I already feel like I&#8217;m not productive enough. I&#8217;ve recently made a professional change in my life that is not yet yielding the results I&#8217;m seeking. Making an album didn&#8217;t further my career even obliquely, nor did it help me establish the kind of life I seek.</p>
<p>It was worth it. Not because I made a great album, although I think that my future self will view it as at least &#8220;flawed but decent&#8221;. It was worth the time because the process of making songs is intrinsically satisfying, despite whatever frustration it may bring. Part of the reason I made the aforementioned professional change is that I did not want to be the kind of guy that works and lives for the future all the way until retirement (which, by the way, for people my age will be between 80 and never). Keeping in line with that, I am going to try make music for today from now on. (Yeah, try to parse that sentence!) Not as much as I did this month, but regularly, since at long last, I can conclude it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
