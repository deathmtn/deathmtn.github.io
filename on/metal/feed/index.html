			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally saw Iron Maiden tonight. They tour only every other year, and they play the humongous venues that foment irritation. So, I&#8217;ve never been.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7276/7453001784_c359a29d6c_z.jpg" alt="Sea of Madness" /></p>
<p>But they are not going to be playing or living forever, so you really should see them. I&#8217;m glad I did. Despite the many obstacles to my enjoyment I hit en route to Maiden&#8217;s performance, I ended up having an ecstatic time.</p>
<p>They were spotlighting stuff from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which is not my favorite Maiden album. Yet they totally sold all these long-ass progressive ragas just on the power of their sound, which is very vivid and very robust live. They made me believe that anything would sound good coming out of them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recite a set list, but here&#8217;s the songs I remember them playing, in approximate order:<br />
<span id="more-98"></span><br />
<i>Moonchild</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know the song well, but it was exciting. Very nice build-up. I shot a few clips of the show here and there. They sound bad, as expected, yet they&#8217;re surprisingly intelligible. I guess I was far back enough. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453118278/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453118278/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">Here&#8217;s one of the opener.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><i>The Evil That Men Do</i><br />
<i>Two Minutes to Midnight</i><br />
<i>The Prisoner</i></p>
<p><i>The Trooper</i></p>
<blockquote><p>The harmonies really breathed and felt richly &#8220;wavy&#8221; like they were maybe playing them a bit rubato. At the same time, the song seemed to whiz by. I was on the edge of every note, headbanging like nuts, and it seemed like it was over in two minutes.</p>
<p>Also, Bruce went the whole nine yards. While wailing about Russian guns, he waved the Union Jack and wore the traditional red suit of the British. Throughout the show, he was running about and climbing all over things. It was not unlike Method Man&#8217;s stage craziness.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Number of the Beast</i></p>
<blockquote><p>So ridiculously exciting. Certainly, part of it is yelling 6! 6-6! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453106342/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453106342/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">Here&#8217;s a little video of that.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i></p>
<p><i>Afraid to Shoot Strangers</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Bruce dedicated this to America and Charlton Heston. I had never heard this song, but it ruled. Lots of abrupt tempo changes, which they played off as no big deal, and so did not seem at all song-breaking. I&#8217;m going to have to check it out.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Fear of the Dark</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I sang along with this loud enough to hear myself and realized I sounded like Anton Maiden. Kept going anyway! Such is the strength of its anthemic call.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Can I Play with Madness?</i><br />
<i>Wasted Years</i><br />
<i>Iron Maiden</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Encore&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Aces High</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I was not surprised by the melodrama that is the encore, but I was surprised it was this. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453098836/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/7453098836/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">That Churchill intro is so goddamned epic</a> that it makes the first fast riff in the song seem ten times bigger. Kinda lost my shit over this one.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Run to the Hills</i></p>
<blockquote><p>
For years, I heard Metallica&#8217;s parody of this intro riff in my head every time I heard the real one. Even after I came to like the song overall, I didn&#8217;t think too much of that riff. Tonight, they brought it to life, and it sounded anything but silly. </p>
<p>Throughout the show, you could tell Bruce Dickinson is a great singer, but here, you really felt like he was commanding perfectly a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>Also, remember that episode of Beavis and Butt-head in which they get taken to jail to be &#8220;Scared Straight,&#8221; but end up singing &#8220;Run to the Hills&#8221; with some inmates? Quite a few guys there looked like those inmates (and quite a few didn&#8217;t, of course).
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</i><br />
<i>Running Free</i></p>
<p><b>Other Notes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Iron Maiden is a very &#8220;ringing&#8221; band. The vocals ring, the bass clangs, and the vocals sing. They&#8217;re also very punchy, but something is always ringing. The metal bands I listened to most in my formative years favored crunching, dense percussiveness over extended reverberating when it came down to it, so it&#8217;s striking to me.
</li>
<li>
Steve Harris is the most commanding bass player I&#8217;ve heard. First off, he&#8217;s loud enough in the mix that he easily cuts through three guitars. Then, he tends to play riffs that are like metal rhythm guitar riffs, and the guitars sometimes end up playing more melodic and less percussive stuff. It&#8217;s not important that the bass lead, and it&#8217;s not possible at certain tempos, but it is salient.
</li>
<li>
As I mentioned above, the guitar harmonies seemed to flourish live. I wonder if it&#8217;s the third guitar. (Janick Gers, their third guitarist, did not record on their older, classic albums.)
</li>
<li>
If you&#8217;ve ever wanted an opportunity to sing &#8220;Whoahhoahoah!&#8221; a lot, a Maiden show is probably just as good for this as a Misfits show.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just listening to an episode of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast/id329875043?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">WTF Podcast</a> with Marc Maron (which I discovered via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-salad-days/id271084108?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">the Salad Days guys</a>) in which he&#8217;s talking about the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Apparently, Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes and pissed the audience off. Maron likes these award shows for reasons he explains in the podcast, so he hated it. </p>
<p>To me, however, it sounded <b>awesome</b>. Not awesome enough for me to dig up and sit through an awards show just to see Gervais giving Hollywood what&#8217;s for, though. But awesome enough for me to imagine it and go &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of party wrecking: When some guys show up at a party to unleash some sort of honest expression, leaving the party shocked and dismayed. The party wrecker receives little support from the people physically present. Yet they continue their wrecking!</p>
<p>I love seeing a party wrecked. Of course, that depends on me not liking the party, or at least feeling that the party could stand to have its bubble burst.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Gervais thing, I recalled other party wrecking incidents. I know what I described above sounds like people just being assholes, but check these out, and see if they don&#8217;t make you think &#8220;Hell, yeah!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDButf0go8&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">The KLF at the BRIT Awards</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CDButf0go8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The KLF built a career on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">formulaically safe music</a>. So formulaic, in fact, that they wrote a detailed manual on how to make it. They knew they were making music whose prime characteristic was that chumps could easily digest it.<br />
<span id="more-61"></span><br />
By 1992, they decided they were done with it, so at the BRIT awards (an industry award show like the Grammys), they invited Extreme Noise Terror, a British grindcore band, to play a version of their hit 3 AM Eternal with them.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like audience received it rather well, so this isn&#8217;t a perfect example of the kind of party wrecking of which I&#8217;m thinking. Still, it&#8217;s a great instance of  people that are accustomed to getting what they want (and defining what others get) <i>not</i> getting what they want.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">Andy Kaufman reading the Great Gatsby</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3Dp6Oh3Fw&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');"><img src="http://death-mountain.com/stuff/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-12.43.26-AM.png" alt="" title="Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby." width="480" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts run by stand-up comedians lately, and I get the impression there&#8217;s immense pressure to connect and deliver. Kaufman got shows booked because of his role as Latka on the sitcom Taxi, and people were expecting for something sort of similar to that sort of comedy. Also, they were expecting stand-up comedy. Knowing this, Kaufman decided that what he&#8217;d rather do is read them the Great Gatsby. So he did, despite boos and disappointment. And of course, he did create comedy. Not for the people there, though, who were the ones putting the pressure on him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not completely clear why I think this is so great. I&#8217;m critical of a lot of performance art and have been part of an unappreciative audience. When I was younger and thought that yelling could actually make a band deviate from its set, I would try to get Slayer to play Spill the Blood. Unlike an awards show audience, I don&#8217;t think a stand-up comedy audience needs to &#8220;eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose this performance pits empathy for a defiant artist against empathy for expectant patrons. Kaufman&#8217;s act happens to be brave enough and defiant enough to win here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oZyWt7pGg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">Metallica at the 1989 Grammys</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7oZyWt7pGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just footage of the performance. I couldn&#8217;t find something with shots of the audience.)</p>
<p>To provide some context, the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/longboredsurfer.com/charts/1989.php?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Fon%2Fmetal%2F');">Billboard top 20</a> then was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>01. Look Away » Chicago<br />
02. My Prerogative » Bobby Brown<br />
03. Every Rose Has Its Thorn » Poison<br />
04. Straight Up » Paula Abdul<br />
05. Miss You Much » Janet Jackson<br />
06. Cold Hearted » Paula Abdul<br />
07. Wind Beneath My Wings » Bette Midler<br />
08. Girl You Know Its True » Milli Vanilli<br />
09. Baby, I Love Your Way-Freebird » Will To Power<br />
10. Giving You The Best That I Got » Anita Baker<br />
11. Right Here Waiting » Richard Marx<br />
12. Waiting For A Star To Fall » Boy Meets Girl<br />
13. Lost In Your Eyes » Debbie Gibson<br />
14. Don&#8217;t Wanna Lose You » Gloria Estefan<br />
15. Heaven » Warrant<br />
16. Girl I&#8217;m Gonna Miss You » Milli Vanilli<br />
17. The Look » Roxette<br />
18. She Drives Me Crazy » Fine Young Cannibals<br />
19. On Our Own » Bobby Brown<br />
20. Two Hearts » Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that was the world that the record industry celebrated, and that was the world of the Grammys.</p>
<p>In the other corner, Metallica had never been on commercial radio, much less on TV on a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; awards show like the Grammys. Before they began the long process of revealing their fallibility and humanness that started around 1991, they were perceived as something akin to a force, rather than as a group of musicians. Sort of like a comet. You might think a comet is awesome, but it is driven by forces outside of the control of man.</p>
<p>This was quite the collision. </p>
<p>Having been introduced to Metallica by the black album, I did not witness the Grammy performance live. When I did see and read about this in the nineties, I absolutely loved the audience reaction. Some of it thought it was novel and cheered, but there were plenty of Clive Davis types that were just stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect that, and they did not have a good time. </p>
<p>And as a guy that did not have a good time at all with the pop music that was hard to get away from back then, I liked that a lot.<br />

<p>You probably remember this, but just in case you don&#8217;t: This dinner is a yearly celebration held by the reporters that cover the White House. The president of the United States is there. No matter how atrocious he may be, the speakers and reporters at the dinner rib him gently and chum it up real good.</p>
<p>Colbert stood about <i>ten feet away</i> from President George W. Bush and just rained crushing bombs on him for half an hour. Iraq, an inability to accept facts, and the politically motivated leak of a CIA field agent&#8217;s identity were all brought up. Yup, uncomfortable, amazing stuff. This was party wrecking at the highest level of power, and it required serious perseverance in addition to bravery and cleverness. </p>

<p>Back then, I was looking for the heaviest music possible. With that territory comes a lot of lyrics that really try to make you say &#8220;holy shit.&#8221; Very little of it did. </p>
<p>Death metal bands espousing the downfall of Christianity was like ranch dressing at a buffet. I tuned it out and listened to just the music. (Which was not necessarily a bad thing.) Black metal bands&#8217; flirtation with Nazism from the safety of their moms&#8217; basements in Norway was just pathetic. </p>
<p>Brujerìa cut through all of that and made me go &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; (Like a machete!) Fake or not, Satanic Mexican drug dealers were a scary idea to which people weren&#8217;t yet numb. It got my attention.</p>

<p>They were novel and impressively crazy which could have been enough, but I liked that they stopped for a bit with Raza Odiada to make a good point in addition to their usual terrorizing. &#8220;Quien te va chingar mas no es Satanas,&#8221; de hecho.</p>
