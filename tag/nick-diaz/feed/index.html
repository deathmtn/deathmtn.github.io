			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That was a great fight. Any fight involving two people with perfect proprioception is bound to be. But the outcome bummed me out more than I thought it would.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t read on if you haven&#8217;t seen the fight yet.</p>
<p><span id="more-79"></span>I already know that skill just isn&#8217;t enough in a lot of situations. But this fight seemed to want make extra-sure that I knew that. </p>
<p>That first round showed that BJ&#8217;s just better (what I think of as &#8220;better&#8221;, at least) than Nick. He slipped and tagged, then took Nick down and took his back, smoothly rolling through Nick&#8217;s struggling. BJ was slicker, faster, and able to circumvent a reach advantage. That is a rare magic, I think.</p>
<p>But after that, he got tired; he got less persistent; and somehow, he ended up getting pelted for two rounds. Some of this was conditioning and concentration, but it <i>felt</i> like it was more a matter of pure determination. Diaz was completely undeterred by quick counters and positional domination. He looked and moved exactly the same as he did before and after setbacks like that. He just wouldn&#8217;t stop pouring it on.</p>
<p>(Although less amazing than Penn, Diaz is extremely skilled in all major areas of mixed martial arts. I don&#8217;t want to give the impression he is a one-dimensional zombie. I just happen to believe his unrelenting aggression is what gets him the victories.)</p>
<p>So, why would I be crestfallen by BJ losing, then? In terms of personal conduct, they are both prone to making unethical accusations. But I usually excuse Nick because I partially buy into the idea that he&#8217;s kinda crazy and because he does it so unintentionally hilariously.</p>
<p>I think it may be because I&#8217;m conditioned to root for the slicker, more skillful competitor, whatever the nature of the contest. After all, as a relatively smart guy that&#8217;s not large, that&#8217;s with whom I&#8217;m supposed to identify, right? Quick and clever vanquishing the brutish and less quick.</p>
<p>But as I have gotten older and come across cleverer and cleverer people with increasing frequency, I have had to question how frequently I&#8217;m on that side of the equation. Certainly, I have had my (not necessarily bad) brutish moments. I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten through more big problems through force and persistence than with ingenuity. </p>
<p>Perhaps this ideal, then, is outmoded for me. No longer that useful. And so, I really should take heart that if you&#8217;re close enough in skill, unrelenting bullheadedness can close the gap. I should, in fact, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-tPXlNdlg" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-tPXlNdlg&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fnick-diaz%2F');">not be scared of this, homie</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, I should let up on assigning myself archetypes, but that&#8217;s not something I do consciously.)</p>
