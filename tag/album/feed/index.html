			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently participated in <a href="http://hmtpng.com" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/hmtpng.com?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">Hometaping</a>. Hometaping is one of those &#8220;do something in a month&#8221; projects. It&#8217;s like National Novel Writing Month, in that it&#8217;s held in November, and like RPM, in that it&#8217;s about making an album. I attempted this last year and failed, although I did get one song out of it, which is one more than I would have written otherwise.</p>
<p>This year, I finished a group of songs that could arguably called an album. <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/isilence/sets/space-and-time-are-done-1?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">You can stream or download it here.</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only 19 minutes, but there&#8217;s seven fairly complete songs. And in the process of writing these songs, I did a handful of improvisations that were fun, even if not all of them made it on the album. (Two of them did.) I didn&#8217;t complete every song I started, either, but I did beat the expectations I had at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>While making this album, I learned a lot of things! According to <a href="http://asianniceguy.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/asianniceguy.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">this guy</a>, life is essentially about three things: Living, loving, and learning. So, I think we can all agree: It is fairly good that I learned.</p>
<p>A lot of what I learned I already knew. (And a lot of what I learned, <i>you</i> already knew.) As strange as that may sound, knowing isn&#8217;t the same as learning. Often, learning is not an on/off kind of thing. Some people read about something and instantly absorb it. Not me, though. I usually have to bump into the problem that the solution solves and flail at it uselessly in my own way before accepting the solution.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So. These things I learned (again) while making this album, and I was glad to learn them!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Even though I don&#8217;t listen to albums as albums very much any more, albums as a unit of work are still useful.</b></p>
<p>I tend to give a new album one or two listens. After that, its songs are absorbed into my sea of music and will pop up at random, disassociated with its album-mates. Every so often, I will hear a song on shuffle, then seek the album. But even then, I might not listen to them in order. I know some people that do still listen to music as albums, but with the way Kids These Days are going, the concept of the album as unit of art to be consumed as a whole is going to find less and less purchase.</p>
<p>As a unit of work, however, I find the album to still be a strong idea. I&#8217;m accustomed to working on one song at a time. During the making of this album, there was some very useful momentum. I didn&#8217;t have to warm up. Buying in bulk is good stuff, even in music writing, it seems. I ended up with 7+ songs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the number of songs I&#8217;ve made each year. (This chart leaves off the many, many noise improvisations I did around 2003.)</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=0:|1996|1997|1998|1999|2000|2001|2002|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010&#038;chxp=0,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010&#038;chxr=0,1996,2010,1|1,0,12&#038;chxs=0,676767,8,0,l,676767&#038;chxt=x,y&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=300x200&#038;cht=bvs&#038;chd=t:2,6,9,3,1,4,4,5,2,2,8,1,0,1,12&#038;chds=0,12&#038;chma=|0,260&#038;chtt=Songs+completed+per+year" alt="Chart" /><br />
<span id="more-49"></span><br />
Heh, so, now that I&#8217;ve put together that chart, I realize that it undermines my point a little bit. Data! Still, despite the spike at 2006, 2010 had the most completed songs of all time. (<i>All time.</i>) And the relative quality of these songs is a bit higher than the pre-2006 songs, on average. Things would be even more dramatic if I was able to graph out songs completed each month. I think it&#8217;s clear that albums get more songs made.</p>
<p>(Oh, re: 2006: Two of those eight songs were done for contests. So, some non-intrinsic motivation helped a little there, too.)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Finishing a song involves more than you think it will.</b></p>
<p>I hear the &#8220;the last 10% is 90% of the work&#8221; cliche a lot about all sorts of projects. I&#8217;ve also experienced it a few times. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve truly taken it to heart, yet. Someday!</p>
<p>At various points during November, I felt that a song was &#8220;mostly done&#8221;. Maybe it needed one more melody or the drums needed to be adjusted, or it just needed final mixing. In all cases that little extra touch took a while. The last additions to a song have to fit to the constraints of what&#8217;s already there (unless you&#8217;re willing to redo a lot) and so they often take longer to come up with than the parts that came before it.</p>
<p>And mixing &#8211; mixing involves repeated listening and trial and error, which is inherently time-consuming, even if it is a more passive activity than composing or playing.<br />
 &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. I enjoy mixing.</b></p>
<p>That said, mixing is a good time. I&#8217;m not saying that because I&#8217;m great at it. I just find mixing very absorbing and entertaining. It is, essentially, listening to music. You listen to the music, make your hypothesis about what&#8217;s wrong with it, make your changes based on that hypothesis, then listen again. So, I guess it&#8217;s also like science.</p>
<p>I had not explicitly realized that I enjoyed mixing before. From a pure enjoyment standpoint, I like it as much as composing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Perspective is easily lost while mixing.</b></p>
<p>You know how when you look at a word for a long time, it starts to look weird and not like the word at all? Something similar can happen when you spend a long time mixing. As you listen to the same thing again and again, your brain might start to tune parts of it out. Then, the next day, as you&#8217;re listening to the mix in your car, you&#8217;re shocked that it has an obvious flaw.</p>
<p>For this album, I often couldn&#8217;t help doing all the mixing in one go because there wasn&#8217;t that much time left after I had recorded it. Ideally, though, I wouldn&#8217;t try to mix things all in one day. I&#8217;d fiddle with things a bit each day on each song, getting fresh perspective for each session. Now that I think about it, I could have done this to an extent with this album. Instead of trying to hammer a song into ship shape once all of its parts were recorded, I could have done some initial mixing, switched to composing or recording a different song, then come back to roughly mixed songs for finer mixing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. My music ego is more fragile than I thought.</b></p>
<p>I had a big &#8220;what was I thinking?&#8221; moment while listening to the previous day&#8217;s mix of a song that was perhaps the worst of its kind that I can remember. I had a freakin&#8217; great time putting the song together and felt great about it the previous night.</p>
<p>During this drive, I was crushed. What is the point of working hard on something, good time or not, if you turn out shit? And how can one&#8217;s judgment from just the previous night be so much worse than it is the next day?</p>
<p>Of course, this was an overreaction. It was not that bad; I just wasn&#8217;t feeling the glow that I felt the previous night. That night, I fixed the problems that I had noticed in the morning, and it was fine again.</p>
<p>The first time you hear one of your ideas expressed, you may be more taken with it than you would normally. Getting too attached to that glow is trouble.</p>
<p>Usually, I keep in mind that what I&#8217;m making at the moment could very well be hated by me in two years. This has happened enough times to be an established pattern. I try to prevent that from dampening my enjoyment, but I use it to temper my expectations. Most of the time.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s good to stay aware, to a degree, that your emotions will ebb and flow as you work, and to not tie them too closely to your worth as a musician.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. Shit you make up on the spot can be just as good as a composition you&#8217;ve been refining for weeks.</b></p>
<p>Three of the seven songs on the album were composed on the spot.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">Crab, Why Do You Smoke?</a> turned out well. Its three riffs were written in the half hour before they were recorded. I had written several riffs the night before, but some of them didn&#8217;t mesh well with each other, it was really hard to come up with drum parts to fit others, and some of them just sucked. </p>
<p>I tossed them and wrote more. I liked one. The others, I thought, well, that&#8217;s OK at best, but hey, this is Hometaping. The level of enthusiasm continued during the recording. When I played them back, they sounded pretty good. Perspective!</p>
<p>The acoustic pieces were written in an even shorter time &#8211; maybe fifteen minutes each. They weren&#8217;t played very tightly, either, as you can hear. They are the songs that dip into the amateur zone. Yet, I think they work.</p>
<p>You need to sit down and just start working sometimes, and good will come of it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7. Playing an acoustic and singing along to it is effective.</b></p>
<p>This kind of playing doesn&#8217;t fit my self-image in some ways. I think of myself first as a composer, then a guitar player. The electric kind, and not without distortion. I sing because it&#8217;s expedient.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;ve fiddled much more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQ-Xg_MS3k" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQ-Xg_MS3k&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">acoustic</a> in the past year than electric. To play the electric (or as I think of it &#8220;regular kind&#8221;) guitar, I need to:</p>
<p>- Plug in the guitar.<br />
- Find a pick.<br />
- Turn on the amp.<br />
- Turn on the POD.</p>
<p>To play the acoustic, I need to:</p>
<p>- Grab the acoustic.</p>
<p>If my time spent in software has taught me anything, it&#8217;s that tiny extra steps can really deter people from bothering with something. People are lazy. I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;ve never really been able to play and sing at the same time. Sometime last year, I just started doing it without even thinking about it. I&#8217;m not sure what clicked.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s nice about writing in this manner is that:</p>
<p>1. You are writing two parts at once.<br />
2. You know the parts fit.<br />
3. You end up writing a vocal line you know you can sing.<br />
4. There is not going to be a problem with establishing a natural vibe.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. Don&#8217;t write lyrics your singing can&#8217;t cash, or something like that.</b></p>
<p>There was one song for which I wrote some lyrics that were clever but were also very wordy. I was counting on myself to be able to be able to sing a syllable almost every beat, without a whole lot of rest. I did it, but crappily, and it detracted from the song. That song ended up being an instrumental.</p>
<p>Crab, Why Do You Smoke? originally had far more words. However, growling takes a lot out of you, and so does shouting. I would have had to sing like goddamn Tom Araya to get all that stuff in. Cleverness and wordplay are great, but I&#8217;m not a rapper. I don&#8217;t need to be a verbal acrobat, and I need to keep that in mind when I write lyrics.</p>
<p>This and the acoustic songs are making me rethinking my devotion to my riff-first process. I&#8217;ve found it easier to come up with a guitar part to fit with existing parts than it come up with vocals to go over some weird riff. I&#8217;m going to try to do guitars last a bit more often.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Having peers working on something similar is encouraging.</b></p>
<p>Like many of these lessons, this is kind of a &#8216;duh&#8217; thing, but I&#8217;ve never had peers composing at the same time. <a href="http://thelearnedfangirl.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/thelearnedfangirl.com/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">Keidra</a> did Hometaping <a href="http://soundcloud.com/keidra" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/soundcloud.com/keidra?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Falbum%2F');">as well</a>, and she posted about her progress. It was really inspiring to know she was digging away at an album, too. My friend Miranda also recorded a song response to one of my songs, which was encouraging. Katt stepped in to do the intro vocals on This Fried Chicken when mine weren&#8217;t really working out, and so I felt even more invested in that song.</p>
<p>Generally, I don&#8217;t have peers or collaborators when writing music. In high school I had a project &#8220;band&#8221;, but most of my interaction with them consisted of haranguing them to get together to practice, learn songs, and/or buy instruments. We didn&#8217;t even get to writing songs. Since then, because I was largely uninterested in being in a band, I haven&#8217;t met anyone that actively wrote songs. Well, outside of people from online music communities. And most of those people were far from encouraging.</p>
<p>This lesson doesn&#8217;t really have much of a usable takeaway, given that whether or not you have colleagues in composition isn&#8217;t really a choice, but I like knowing it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. I react well to editing-style work and short feedback cycles.</b></p>
<p>I forgot this about myself. When I get to see what my changes are doing to my work I sink right into it. Every aspect of music production affords this. Photoshopping works the same way.</p>
<p>I work as a programmer, and sometimes you get to see the immediate effects of your changes, but oft times you have to build a few layers or break down a few layers to see any effect. There&#8217;s techniques you can use to shorten the feedback cycle as much as possible, but they don&#8217;t apply to everything. And sometimes you have to work on something in you are not emotionally invested, regardless of the length of the feedback cycle.</p>
<p>It feels good to concentrate for long periods of time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>11. Making music should be a regular part of life.</b></p>
<p>I was concerned about the amount of time that making an album in a month would eat up. I already feel like I&#8217;m not productive enough. I&#8217;ve recently made a professional change in my life that is not yet yielding the results I&#8217;m seeking. Making an album didn&#8217;t further my career even obliquely, nor did it help me establish the kind of life I seek.</p>
<p>It was worth it. Not because I made a great album, although I think that my future self will view it as at least &#8220;flawed but decent&#8221;. It was worth the time because the process of making songs is intrinsically satisfying, despite whatever frustration it may bring. Part of the reason I made the aforementioned professional change is that I did not want to be the kind of guy that works and lives for the future all the way until retirement (which, by the way, for people my age will be between 80 and never). Keeping in line with that, I am going to try make music for today from now on. (Yeah, try to parse that sentence!) Not as much as I did this month, but regularly, since at long last, I can conclude it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
