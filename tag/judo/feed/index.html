			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I picked up a graph paper notebook and some blank index cards. They were 37¢! (Back to school supply sales: Still somehow captivating.)</p>
<p>I already drew a dungeon in the notebook. Then, I drew some guys fighting.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know why grids inspire freehand drawing of figures that don&#8217;t seem to take advantage of grids, until a little while ago, when I found out about <a href="http://www.thegridsystem.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thegridsystem.org/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');">grid-based design</a>. A lot of magazine and web page layouts that don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with a grid are actually rooted in grids. They impose a subconscious order that appeals to your brain. Dant-dant-dah! Maybe it does the same for freehand drawing.</p>
<p>The drawing turned out to be two drawings in one! </p>
<p>1. Guy that just passed guard and is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');">establishing mount</a>/guy that&#8217;s bridging to escape mount.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/" title="Trying to bridge out of mount" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4870180098/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4870180098_7a986d5bc3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>2. Guy that&#8217;s trying to pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(grappling)" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_grappling?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');">guard</a>/guy that is setting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_(grappling)#Ground_work" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_grappling_Ground_work?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');">sweep</a> with his guard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/" title=Passing guard" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/4869566873/?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fdeath-mountain.com%2Ftag%2Fjudo%2F');"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4869566873_7bb1577e3d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an accident that a drawing of one situation flipped over looks like a drawing of another situation, but I bet it&#8217;s not all that common when drawing grappling situations. </p>
<p>You know: martial arts and the yin yang and the glass half-empty and the Circle of Life and all that!</p>
